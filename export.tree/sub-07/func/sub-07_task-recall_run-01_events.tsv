7.1	8.0	Ok, so I guess I’ll start by saying that there were two lobby clips, just because I know you record those, and I did remember them.
14.1	7.0	So it says, “Let’s all go to the lobby and get some snacks,” and it’s all pink, and there's boxes that are dancing, and so on.
20.1	4.0	Ok, so the last clip was the bus stop.
24.1	6.0	It begins with a guy standing at the bus stop, wearing white headphones and a red t-shirt.
29.1	10.0	And he has a bag with strawberry ice cream that’s slowly melting, because it’s really hot, and he has sweat stains on his shirt.
38.1	4.0	Then this car drives in, it’s an SUV.
41.1	5.0	And a woman pulls up to the curb, and she gets out, leaves her car door open.
46.1	7.0	And then she walks to the phone booth and makes a call.
52.1	6.0	And I’m pretty sure her car starts to slowly slide down the street while she’s doing that.
57.1	3.0	In any case, she starts to walk towards the guy.
60.1	3.0	She needs to use his phone.
62.1	6.0	I guess she couldn’t get through on the payphone or something, or she didn’t have money.
67.1	8.0	But she walks towards the guy and she asks him if she could use his phone and not to worry, that she's not going to steal it.
75.1	3.0	So he gives her the phone.
77.1	3.0	She gets on the phone, she makes a call.
80.1	6.0	Then she starts saying like, “Where is she? I’m gonna call the police. Where are you?”
87.1	5.0	And then she’s like obviously kind of frantic and upset.
91.1	3.0	Then she throws the phone down on the ground.
95.1	8.0	The guy in the red t-shirt goes and picks it up and says, “Hey, this is a $60 phone, lady. Are you gonna pay me back for it?”
103.1	4.0	And then further down the road this car pulls up.
107.1	9.0	And this guy comes out who’s wearing like part of a tux but without the jacket, so just the black pants and like suspenders and a white shirt.
116.1	5.0	The lady goes to him, and the guy with the red shirt is kinda walking behind her.
120.1	5.0	And the lady is saying, “ Where is she? Where is she?”
125.1	6.0	And the guy who came out of the car is like, “Who’s this other guy?”
131.1	4.0	And the lady says, “Just a friend,” and the guy’s like, “What?
135.1	3.0	She's not my friend, she just borrowed my phone.
137.1	3.0	I wanted to see if I could get some money for it.”
139.1	7.0	Anyways, the, the guy who came out of the car and the woman start having this exchange.
145.1	6.0	And the guy who came out of the car says to the red-shirted guy, “Do you know who I am?”
150.1	9.0	And then he pauses for a second, and he's like, “Oh, you're the Great Aldino, and you're his assistant, like you guys are on TV.”
159.1	14.0	And then the, the woman kinda goes nuts and she pulls out a gun, and then the magician guy says, “Oh, well I have one too, like is yours loaded?” that kind of thing.
173.1	5.0	And then eventually the woman goes to the car.
177.1	5.0	She opens the trunk to, or she tries to open the trunk to look inside.
181.1	11.0	And the man with the red shirt now is with the magician, and the magician tells him to pay attention, and he pulls out this thing to hypnotize him.
191.1	5.0	It’s this box with like a cross on it with some type of bone thing inside.
197.1	5.0	And so he starts chanting to hypnotize the guy in the red shirt.
201.1	7.0	And meanwhile the woman has managed to open the trunk and sees something inside.
207.1	7.0	And the magician has hypnotized the guy who drops his bag with the ice cream in it which is all melted.
214.1	8.0	It goes all over the ground, and the guy drops on the ground and starts like pawing and twitching as if he’s a dog that’s asleep.
221.1	10.0	And the woman comes around from the car, and the magician is like, “Oh, crap,” because he probably said the wrong words when he was trying to hypnotize the guy.
230.1	4.0	And so he's like reading over what he should have said.
234.1	5.0	And the woman shoots him, and he shoots the woman, and they both fall to the ground.
238.1	10.0	And now the guy with the red shirt is acting like a dog, and licking the ice cream on the ground and starts barking and like sniffing around.
247.1	7.0	And then as he’s barking he starts hearing somebody else bark in return, or like some, somebody, some dog.
253.1	8.0	Anyways he starts crawling, and then this girl comes, also a dog now, obviously hypnotized by the magician.
260.1	4.0	And they start sniffing each other, as dogs do.
263.1	7.0	And then they go off down the street. Ok.
270.1	4.0	The clip before that was Post-It Love.
273.1	9.0	It starts with these two people who are making photocopies side-by-side in an office building.
281.1	8.0	And then they like both look up over the partitions that are slightly like lower than their heads, and look over at each other.
288.1	7.0	And then the, the, they all go off to their respective desks.
294.1	13.0	The first one the guy goes, and he sits down at his desk, and he opens a file, a file folder, and sees something inside 
306.1	6.0	which I didn’t note because I was distracted ‘cause the volume was loud, and then I asked Janice to turn down the volume.
311.1	14.0	The next time I kinda tuned in was when the woman was at her, going to her desk and then she like opened the curtains or the blinds and saw this flower that was made of post-it notes on her window.
326.1	7.0	And then the next kind of short part is the guy, who’s now in the bathroom, adjusting his tie.
333.1	9.0	Somebody goes into a stall, closes the stall door, and on the stall door is, I think, a purple heart or something else made of post-its.
344.1	4.0	And then there's another one that I’m not quite remembering.
347.1	12.0	Oh, the woman goes into like this, kinda closet like storage closet, opens the door, turns on the light and sees something else made of post-its that I’m not quite remembering.
359.1	8.0	And the last scene she's like carrying away this armload of post-it notes in all different colors.
366.1	13.0	And she's walking towards like the main area of the offices, and she looks, and there's this massive portrait of two people’s faces made completely out of post-it notes that takes up the entire wall.
378.1	5.0	And the guy is there adding a few final post-it touches.
382.1	4.0	And then they look at each other and smile.
387.1	3.0	The one before that is The Black Hole.
389.1	8.0	It also starts with a guy who is making photocopies and drinking coffee.
396.1	8.0	And the machine gets stuck or something, and then it produces a sheet of paper that has a large black hole on it.
404.1	8.0	The guy takes it, looks at it, puts it down, continues trying to make photocopies and drink his coffee.
411.1	10.0	Then he puts the cup on top of the, the black hole, and it disappears, and he's like, “Oh.”
420.1	11.0	Then he pushes his hand like in, through the paper with the black hole, reaches in, pulls his coffee cup back out.
430.1	6.0	And so he’s probably thinking, “Oh, this is kinda cool. I’ll, I wanna see what else I can do with it.”
435.1	14.0	So he looks around, sees a vending machine and takes the sheet of paper with the black hole, moves towards the vending machine, puts it over the glass and reaches in and grabs a candy bar.
448.1	12.0	Then he opens the candy bar, starts eating it, looks around at what else he can use this black hole for, and he sees this door that’s locked, and apparently contains a safe.
459.1	9.0	So he puts the black hole on top of the door, the, the wooden door, reaches through, unlocks it.
467.1	11.0	Then opens the door, goes through, and there's this small gray safe that’s at the bottom of the, like on the floor.
477.1	5.0	And then he takes the sheet with the black hole and puts it on top of the safe.
482.1	10.0	And it, at some point he must’ve gotten a piece of tape and I didn’t notice but the sheet of paper stays there, taped to the safe.
491.1	7.0	And he reaches his hand through, through into the safe and starts pulling out wads of cash.
497.1	5.0	And he pulls out more and more and more, puts them down on the floor.
501.1	4.0	He's getting kinda greedy, looks around seeing if anybody sees him.
504.1	5.0	Nobody’s coming, so he pulls out more and more and more money.
508.1	6.0	And then he's kind of reaching the end of the safe there, but he wants to see if he can get out just a little bit more.
513.1	6.0	So he starts to reach in further and further and actually goes into the safe.
518.1	8.0	And as he does so, his pants or his shirt catches the tape that he used to put the black hole on the safe.
525.1	7.0	And the, the sheet with the black hole comes down, and he's in the safe.
531.1	5.0	And now he's trapped in there, pounding on the door, and nobody comes to save him.
537.1	3.0	The one before that is The Prisoner.
541.1	5.0	It starts off with this guy, who’s in like this quirky little village.
546.1	6.0	And he is like at a cafe outside with these little tables.
551.1	3.0	And a woman comes.
554.1	4.0	And I forget the exact exchange they have at the beginning.
559.1	10.0	But he asks, I don’t remember exactly what he asks her, but eventually I think he asks her about a phone.
570.1	7.0	And so she tells him where the phone is, and he goes to, to make a phone call.
576.1	5.0	And when he goes to make a phone call, they ask him like what’s his number.
580.1	7.0	He doesn’t know what they're talking about, and he says like, “I don’t have a number,” and they say, “No number, no phone call.”
587.1	6.0	And so he's obviously confused, he doesn’t know where he is really, and so he's walking around looking kind of puzzled.
592.1	4.0	And then this woman pulls up in like this golf cart.
597.1	13.0	Oh no wait, before that he went to this little thing that has like different numbers pinned up with different keys that he could push and different descriptions as to what the numbers could bring.
609.1	8.0	And he's looking at that, and he pushes one of the numbers, and when he, when he does that, a woman pulls up in a golf cart.
616.1	5.0	And then he gets into the golf cart with her, and they start driving around.
620.1	7.0	And she asks him like where he wants to go, and I think he says France or something, and then she says like, “No, that’s international, we can't do that.”
627.1	15.0	And they have some kind of discussion at some point, I missed some of the words, but something about people like Czechs and Poles, and I don’t even remember why that came up, but then after she said that, she said, “Yeah, we’re quite cosmopolitan.”
641.1	6.0	And she's driving him around, and they see like somebody on a bike, and they're going through all these roundabouts.
646.1	11.0	And you see that they're in like this little village that has lots of funnily painted little shops, kinda like a little funhouse or toy thing.
657.1	8.0	Anyways, so they're, they're driving around, and eventually he like gets out, and he goes into this store.
665.1	6.0	And he sees this guy there, this like kind of heavy-set guy who’s behind the counter.
670.1	7.0	And he walks to the counter and he tells the guy that he wants a map.
676.1	4.0	And the guy asks him like, “What type of map do you want?”
679.1	3.0	And he’s like, “Whatever, just give me any map.”
681.1	21.0	And so the guy gives him a map, and the, the main character unfolds the map on the counter and looks at it and sees basically just some descriptions that say like, “Mountains,” “Village,” and just like a caricature of like a small town.
702.1	5.0	And he tells the guy, “No, can you give me like a larger map?”
706.1	5.0	So he obviously wants to see more area, like what surrounds the village.
710.1	6.0	And the guy asks him again, “Like what type of map? Like do you want it in color or something like that?”
716.1	6.0	And he says, “Whatever, like just give me a map. I just want it to be like a larger area.”
722.1	9.0	And he gives him the map, and he opens it, and it’s like a bigger, like a physically bigger map, like larger, but it doesn’t have more space around the town.
730.1	7.0	And he's like, “You know, I wanna see more area.”
737.1	6.0	And I’m blanking on how this one ends.
742.1	8.0	It might’ve ended just about there, but the guy behind the counter probably makes some comment, but I, I don’t remember what it is.
752.1	8.0	Ok, so the one before that was the one with the rock.
759.1	10.0	So it starts off with this massive rock, who is kind of, the rock is like personified as, you know, a person.
768.1	5.0	So the rock has eyes and a nose, and I don’t know if it has a mouth.
772.1	3.0	It definitely has eyes and a nose.
774.1	12.0	And it’s a huge rock, and its looking out over like this quaint little stream, and there's like life around and this little green creature that pops up from the water and goes onto a rock and then pops back in.
786.1	5.0	And the rock is like getting kind of tired, and so he closes his eyes to sleep.
790.1	11.0	And as he's sleeping, the earth undergoes massive changes, like, you know, the, the ice age and like dinosaur ages and so on.
800.1	6.0	It kind of moves through many, many different stages, like millions and millions of years.
807.1	10.0	And then when the rock wakes back up, it’s been millions of years, and so he’s kind of worn away to a much smaller rock than he was initially.
816.1	10.0	And he wakes up because there are, is somebody on his back who is chopping down this little tree that was like growing out of the rock.
826.1	6.0	And then the rock is probably annoyed, because he’s been woken up out of his sleep.
831.1	6.0	And then there's people that are next, that are by him, building away, making things.
837.1	14.0	And then the rock like kind of, I think he gets up, but he moves away to somewhere else and goes to try to sleep somewhere else, like pulling up against a tree or something like that.
852.1	13.0	And, but then he’s kind of taken away by other people and carted away where he’s made into a component of some kind of like mill or something that grounds I guess grains or something like that.
864.1	7.0	I’m not sure what it is, like this thing rotates, and I think he grinds grains into flour or something like that.
871.1	5.0	So he spends some of his life doing that, kind of rotating around and grinding things.
876.1	9.0	But then he’s taken away again, and now, the next time he’s fashioned into a cannonball.
885.1	3.0	He’s put into a cannon.
887.1	6.0	He’s shot off and lands somewhere.
893.1	6.0	I don’t remember where, but the rest of the clip is basically about the evolution of this rock’s life.
898.1	5.0	So after being in the cannonball, he ends up being like in a smaller rock.
902.1	5.0	And I think he ends up being on the beach at some point.
906.1	11.0	Oh no, he’s, he’s kicked by some guy who is walking along the street, so now the rock is much smaller, and the guy kicks him.
917.1	3.0	He’s clearly frustrated at something.
919.1	13.0	And the rock eventually goes through like this window, maybe after the guy kicks him, goes through this window, hits a guy who’s having like dinner with his significant other, and then like rolls out of the window.
931.1	8.0	And eventually the rock ends up in a beach, and now he’s very, very tiny, in among the sand.
939.1	9.0	And this, a machine comes and scoops up a bunch of sand, which it’s clear is going to be made into glass.
947.1	18.0	And so this rock, now this tiny little rock is poured into fire, and fashioned into a glass lens or window of some sort that is put onto like a space shuttle that’s launched into space.
964.1	8.0	And it goes through, you know, like I guess the atmosphere, and burns up and whatever.
971.1	10.0	Eventually it hits another planet, and it hits another planet, the glass comes apart.
980.1	14.0	And now this rock somehow, I’m not sure how, but it somehow trans-, it, it transforms into another enormous rock, exactly like the one that was in the beginning.
993.1	9.0	And now again he’s in front of a stream, looking fondly on as it kind of rolls away in front of him.
1001.1	5.0	Ok, so let me make sure I described all of the ones in the last bit.
1007.1	6.0	The rock, the post-its, the black hole, the prisoner, the bus stop, okay.
1012.1	4.0	So now to the first 25 minutes.
1015.1	2.0	Let me see if I can remember those.
1017.1	4.0	Alright, the first one was Catch Me If You Can.
1021.1	11.0	I’ve never seen the movie, so I, I assume the game show part was part of the movie, but there was like two related segments.
1031.1	17.0	The first part was Catch Me If You Can game show with three contestants, who I guess are trying to compete for the part of somebody named Frank, Frank Williams Abagnale.
1048.1	6.0	The middle one is Leonardo DiCaprio, and I’m really bad with names, so I don’t know who the other two actors are.
1054.1	2.0	But they're introduced and then, 
1056.1	16.0	the, the voiceover says something about the background of this Frank Williams, I don’t know if it’s Williams, Frank something Abagnale character about how he impersonated a bunch of different jobs,
1071.1	13.0	I think including something like a judge maybe or someone high up in court, maybe a surgeon, and something else, I don’t know, all, all pretty high positions.
1083.1	10.0	Anyways, the three people, who are all dressed as like navy captains or something like that, they move behind three different podiums, and they have a seat.
1093.1	4.0	And this woman starts asking them questions.
1096.1	9.0	The first question she asked the first contestant is something like, “Why, why did you try to go for all those professions?”
1104.1	4.0	And he’s like, “It comes down to dollars and cents.
1107.1	5.0	"I guess those are the ways that I could make a lot of money."""
1111.1	8.0	And she goes to Leonardo DiCaprio’s character, and she says something about like, “How does it feel when you were finally caught?”
1118.1	12.0	And then he, he mentions the name of the person who caught him, Carl, Carl Hambur, Hamley, something like that.
1129.1	16.0	And then it cuts away to Tom Hanks, who is this Carl something character, who is wearing like gray raincoat and has an umbrella, and he’s outside, and he's getting rained on.
1146.1	9.0	And he, I think, is trying to get into the prison to see this Frank character.
1154.1	10.0	And so he’s, he’s taken in by like a policeman, and he’s shown to the cell where, where Frank is hidden away.
1163.1	17.0	We don’t see him at this point, but he’s shown like a little stool, and he’s told that he can sit there, that there is like this little doorway thing, which he isn’t allowed to pass anything through to the prisoner, but he can sit there and talk to him.
1179.1	8.0	And so the Tom Hanks character, Carl, I think, whatever, is sitting there, 
1186.1	10.0	and then he brings out like this book, and I think he starts reading him something about like different articles, something that is clearly, I guess, relevant to his case or how he's gonna be tried or something.
1197.1	8.0	And now we see Frank like holed up in his little cell, with long straggly hair, really, really sick, like coughing a lot.
1204.1	4.0	His cough sounds really phlegmy and gross.
1208.1	9.0	So he’s coughing a ton, and the Tom Hanks character is sitting out front trying to read him through like these different articles.
1217.1	9.0	And at some point it like starts to like drizzle on him or something, so he takes out his umbrella, pulls it up, puts it on top of him and starts reading.
1226.1	3.0	And his cough gets really, really, really bad.
1229.1	6.0	And then eventually, and by his I mean Frank’s cough gets really, really bad.
1235.1	11.0	"And then he like falls forward, and the Carl character says like, “Oh, somebody come, like we need help. We need to take him to a hospital."""
1246.1	2.0	"""I feel like he’s really sick.”"
1247.1	7.0	And so they pull Frank out of the little cell and take him to like the hospital ward.
1254.1	4.0	And they're saying like they have to get him some treatment.
1257.1	4.0	They have to get him to America or something like that.
1261.1	7.0	And then the Carl character is saying something about how he worked really hard to get him here, and they can't lose him.
1268.1	7.0	And they're kind of conversing a while with the curtains pulled around Frank.
1274.1	6.0	And then the next time they check behind the curtains, he’s gone.
1281.1	17.0	"And then the next scene we see is like Frank who is like coughing, still like coughing his lungs out, running very slowly, kind of stumbling through, trying to escape, going through like the prison with all of the other prisoners yelling like, “Frank, Frank, Frank."""
1297.1	4.0	And he's like stumbling, trying to get away.
1301.1	10.0	But then all of the, the other policeman and the detective or whoever, they are coming up behind him, obviously gonna catch up with him.
1311.1	7.0	But he's still trying to get away, and then he like drops down to the floor and tries to crawl away really slowly.
1318.1	4.0	But eventually they get to him, and he falls backward.
1322.1	4.0	I don’t remember anything after that, so I think it must’ve ended then.
1327.1	1.0	Ok.
1329.1	4.0	The next one, I think it was The Record.
1332.1	10.0	So it starts with this, this was a cartoon, and starts with like this redheaded girl who’s in her little like apartment, 
1342.1	8.0	and she has a box of pizza, and she opens it, and she gets out a slice, and then she’s gonna start to eat, but she gets some mail.
1350.1	10.0	And so she goes to her door, and opens the door and gets her mail out, then sits back on her seat and pulls out a record.
1359.1	7.0	It’s called A Single Life, and she puts the record on the record player and starts to play it.
1366.1	5.0	And then she's listening, she’s listening, and it kind of skips a little bit to a different song.
1370.1	6.0	And she notices that when it does that, her pizza kind of like disappears.
1375.1	6.0	Well it doesn’t disappear, but the slice in her hand goes down to like close to the crust.
1381.1	6.0	And then when she adjusts the, like the needle on the record player, it kind of grows back.
1386.1	10.0	And so she messes around with this for a bit, and she notices that she could make the bit of the pizza go up and then disappear again and come back up and disappear again.
1395.1	13.0	And so she starts messing around with the record player a bit more, and notices that she could make the entire pizza including like the bit in the box disappear and then come back, and disappear and then come back.
1407.1	4.0	So she skips around a little bit more.
1411.1	6.0	And then suddenly when she skips, she’s now in a completely different apartment.
1416.1	8.0	It’s like fancier and like all sleek and posh, and she's like well dressed, and she has a baby.
1423.1	5.0	Well, I mean, she’s pregnant, she doesn’t have a baby, but she's pregnant.
1427.1	6.0	And then she skips around with the needle again, but the, the record player’s always there in front of her.
1432.1	6.0	So she, she skips again, and then she’s no longer pregnant.
1437.1	4.0	And then she’s pregnant again, she's no longer pregnant.
1440.1	6.0	And then she decided to skip ahead until she already has a baby in her arms, and she's no longer pregnant.
1445.1	5.0	But then like the baby starts wailing and crying, and she's like, “I don’t wanna have anymore of this.”
1449.1	9.0	And so she skips again, and then she's like a little child, little like two-year-old or a toddler.
1457.1	6.0	Again, the record player is in front of her, but she's like in, you know, a child’s room.
1462.1	10.0	And she's probably thinking like, “No, I don’t want this either,” and so she tries to skip ahead to the record again, but her little arms can barely reach it, but eventually she gets it.
1471.1	10.0	And she forces the record to skip again, and this time she’s an old lady, old lady in a wheelchair, and she’s probably thinking, “No, I don’t want this either.”
1480.1	7.0	And so she tries to move forward to make the record like kinda skip again to like a different track.
1487.1	13.0	But the record keeps jumping on its own, and every time it does that, it kind of moves her back in time, so she moves forward in her armchair, in her wheelchair, but then is forced to jump back in time.
1500.1	4.0	She does that a few bits, and it’s like she’s stuck in this loop.
1503.1	6.0	But eventually she gets it to, to skip ahead to like another track.
1508.1	4.0	And this time again she's an old lady in a walker, 
1512.1	6.0	and I don’t remember what happens from here.
1519.1	4.0	I feel like she might’ve fallen, but I'm not 100% sure.
1522.1	3.0	That’s all I can remember from that one.
1526.1	2.0	Ok.
1529.1	6.0	The next one, ok, so I think it’s the boyfriend one.
1535.1	13.0	So it’s this woman who’s sitting at a table across from her, I guess it’s her husband not her boyfriend, although I think the clip was called The Boyfriend, because he has the wedding ring.
1547.1	5.0	Anyway, they're sitting across from each other, and they're having dinner.
1552.1	10.0	And she asks him if he wants a glass of wine, and he's like, something like, “No, I’m on call tomorrow,” or “I’m on call,” or something like that, so he can't have wine.
1562.1	12.0	So she pours herself a glass of wine, and she downs the whole thing really quickly while looking at him and then pours herself some more wine.
1573.1	5.0	And then he's eating kind of methodically, kind of robotically, and she's looking at him.
1578.1	10.0	And then I think she asks him something about how he likes the dinner or something, and he's like, “It’s really good. The asparagus is quite tender.”
1587.1	6.0	And she's like, “Yeah, they say it’s an aphrodisiac,” and he's like, “Who’s they?”
1592.1	4.0	And she's like, “I don’t know, just something they say.”
1596.1	4.0	Anyways, they are talking a little bit.
1599.1	6.0	I don’t remember what else they talk about specifically, but she's obviously getting really annoyed with him.
1604.1	3.0	"She's like, you know, “Why can't you just like have a drink?"""
1607.1	4.0	"""It’s not like you're a surgeon, you're like a computer analyst, or something like that."""
1610.1	2.0	"""Just have a drink.”"
1611.1	6.0	And then she throws some, like part of her wine on him.
1616.1	5.0	And then he takes out a cigarette, puts it in his mouth, lights it.
1622.1	3.0	And she's like, “Oh no, you're not smoking in my house.”
1627.1	4.0	And I guess she somehow puts out the cigarette, I don’t remember how.
1630.1	3.0	But then he puts another in, and he lights it.
1632.1	4.0	And she's getting like really, really annoyed.
1636.1	19.0	And I don’t remember the next few details, but eventually she like, she goes up to him, and we find that he has like a switch in the back of his neck, which she turns off, and he like, you know, stops functioning, because apparently he’s like a robot.
1655.1	6.0	And she thinks, probably, she probably thinks to herself, “Well I can do better than this.”
1660.1	9.0	And so she goes to her computer and she logs on to this website where you can buy your robotic boyfriend, husband.
1669.1	6.0	So she sits down, and she's like browsing all the better options that she could get.
1674.1	8.0	So she finds like a later model that is probably better, and this guy who is like a rock climber or something like that.
1681.1	8.0	And she calls up and says that she's like not happy with her current model, and she’d kind of like an upgrade.
1689.1	2.0	And they're like, “What’s your complaint?”
1690.1	8.0	"And she's like, “You know, he's like lacking ambition,” and they're like, “Yeah we get this complaint a lot with that series."""
1698.1	4.0	"""What can I offer you? Like some other, like higher-end model?”"
1701.1	3.0	And she's like, “Yeah, I think so.”
1704.1	5.0	And they're like, “What would you like?” and she’s like, “I don’t know, maybe a rock climber.”
1708.1	8.0	And then she like clicks through, and she’s like, she sees like a masseuse, and she's like, “No wait, maybe a masseuse or a rock-climbing masseuse.”
1716.1	11.0	And then she gets a delivery later of her new robotic boyfriend, husband person.
1726.1	10.0	And then they're taking away her old one, but she, she takes the wedding ring off the old one and puts it on the new one.
1736.1	14.0	And the new one is like this all outdoorsy type guy, who is now carted in and put in the same seat where her old robotic husband boyfriend person was.
1749.1	6.0	And she sits down across from him on the table, after she turns on the switch of course.
1755.1	4.0	And then he's kind of slow getting started, a little bit methodical.
1759.1	3.0	But then he like you know, comes to life.
1762.1	4.0	And she asks him if he wants a drink.
1765.1	6.0	"And he's like, “No, I can't. I have a, I have a climb tomorrow."""
1770.1	4.0	And she's probably thinking like, “Oh no, here we go again.”
1774.1	7.0	Then he takes a bite of his asparagus, and he's like, “Mmm, this is tender.”
1780.1	6.0	And then she's probably thinking at this point like, “I can't believe he's having this, we’re having this conversation again.”
1786.1	6.0	But then he looks up at her, and he's like, “They say its an aphrodisiac.”
1792.1	6.0	And she's like happy now, smiling a little bit and says, “Who’s they?”
1797.1	4.0	"And he's like, “I don’t know. It’s just something they say."""
1801.1	8.0	And then he gets up and goes around the long table to her and stands behind her, and is like, “How was your day?”
1808.1	8.0	And she's like, “Oh,” ‘cause she’s like obviously happy to be having this conversation, pleased with her new purchase.
1815.1	9.0	And she's like, “Oh, this morning, I was like, I went into the shop to get some stuff to get ready for tonight.”
1823.1	4.0	Oh, I forgot to mention it’s her anniversary, that’s why they were having this dinner.
1827.1	6.0	And I think part of the earlier complaint was something about like, “Oh, it’s our anniversary. Can't you just have a drink?”
1833.1	2.0	Anyway, they're back to the current moment.
1834.1	5.0	She’s like, yeah, she went shopping to get stuff for tonight.
1839.1	4.0	And he's like massaging her shoulders as she's talking.
1843.1	3.0	And she's clearly very pleased with the massage.
1847.1	7.0	He keeps on massaging her, and she's talking, and then his hands get closer and closer to her neck.
1853.1	5.0	And then we find that he switches her off.
1857.1	8.0	So her face drops forward, and then the camera zooms around behind her, and we see that she also has a switch at the back of her neck.
1864.1	5.0	And dude’s apparently very smart, because he turned her off to shut her up, and then he goes forward and sits himself down on the armchair in front of the TV, turns it on, and starts watching.
1880.1	4.0	Alright, the next one I think was The Shoe.
1884.1	5.0	So it starts off with this guy’s shoe, that’s what we see.
1889.1	7.0	Some, the text in the top left says something about like where, where it began, or where it ends up.
1895.1	3.0	I think it’s where it began, I can’t remember.
1898.1	3.0	But the guy’s there.
1900.1	3.0	The guy’s shoe, he’s leaning against a car.
1903.1	4.0	And he's like super tough, and so he's drinking milk.
1906.1	6.0	So he's opening this carton of milk and drinking the milk while propped up against the car.
1912.1	15.0	And then this guy comes out, and then apparently the dude who’s drinking the milk, it’s not his car, it’s somebody else’s car, and he chases him away, and so the guy who’s drinking the milk walks away from the car, still drinking the milk.
1927.1	6.0	At some point he noticed this woman who was across the street and decided that he wanted to impress her or something.
1933.1	4.0	So he's walking along, looking at her, kind of stumbles a bit.
1936.1	6.0	And he looks towards her, and then she stumbles a bit, kind of like making fun of him.
1942.1	6.0	And then he does a few more things that she starts to copy, like I think he starts swinging his hands or something like that.
1947.1	5.0	And then she starts swinging her hands and looking over at him.
1952.1	9.0	And then she starts like waving her arms behind her back and like bending over, and then he waves his arms behind his back and in front of him and bends over.
1960.1	4.0	And so they keep walking along this street.
1963.1	5.0	Each one is copying what the other one’s doing, clearly having fun and laughing.
1969.1	7.0	And then they get to an intersection, and she stops suddenly.
1975.1	5.0	And she clearly wants him to stop, because otherwise he’s gonna walk right in front of this truck.
1980.1	12.0	And so she stops, hoping that he’ll stop, and then she like raises her arms up, acts surprised and shocked and trying to like get him to imitate her, which would mean that he’d stop.
1991.1	6.0	But he is having so much fun that he doesn’t stop, he just keeps walking forward.
1996.1	6.0	He keeps walking into the intersection, is hit by a truck, shoe flies off.
2001.1	9.0	You see the shoe land in the street, and the camera pans a little bit, and then we see a woman’s shoe that’s next to it.
2010.1	5.0	Alright, the last one, Keith Reynolds.
2014.1	10.0	So, a little stick figure in a car drives up to a building, gets out of the car, and gets its hat and its briefcase.
2023.1	7.0	It’s Keith Reynolds, and Keith Reynolds is really excited, because he is looking forward to his promotion that day.
2030.1	9.0	He is the most junior type of business analyst, and he's like really, really waiting for this promotion that he knows is gonna happen today.
2040.1	6.0	So he walks in, and we see kind of a cut through of his building.
2045.1	8.0	So we see the many different floors of the office building that he’s working in and the people on the different floors.
2052.1	16.0	And he gets into his elevator, and he, he goes up, and he gets out, and there's this woman, who’s a pink stick figure, bending over and like putting some stuff in or taking some stuff out of a cabinet, or something like that.
2067.1	4.0	Her name’s Sara, and Keith wants to impress Sara.
2071.1	4.0	So he wants to get this promotion, and he wants to impress this girl.
2074.1	6.0	And so he walks in, and he always tries to get her to talk to him.
2079.1	8.0	And he tries to make her know that she should spend the rest of his life, her life with him.
2086.1	4.0	And the way he does that is by always offering her coffee.
2089.1	4.0	And so he offers her coffee as he always does.
2092.1	3.0	She never wants any, but he offers it anyway.
2094.1	2.0	She takes it.
2095.1	4.0	We see her take the coffee, dump it out of the window.
2098.1	3.0	Unfortunately, the hot coffee
