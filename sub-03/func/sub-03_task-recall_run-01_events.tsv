7.6	N/A	Okay so, it begins with a cartoon and some singing and some animals and people I think?
16.6	N/A	And they're singing to go to the lobby to get some snacks I believe.
22.6	N/A	And they sing about getting popcorn, and getting candy and chocolate.
29.6	N/A	Um and there's images of the popcorn, and images of them eating candy and chocolate.
38.6	N/A	Um and so yeah so they sing about that and then it ends with the words, let's all go to the lobby to get ourselves a snack I believe is what it says?
55.6	N/A	And then Catch Me If You Can is the first story.
59.6	N/A	And it begins with a game show and we're introduced to three men.
59.6	N/A	"Well the game show is called ""Tell the truth"" and the game show host introduces us to the three men."
65.6	N/A	And they're each named Frank William Abagnale.
65.6	N/A	And he's a con man and he basically did a variety of cons before the age of 19.
71.6	N/A	He was like an attorney general, he worked in a hospital as a surgeon, and he did something else.
76.6	N/A	So anyways they go and they sit at a table, or like a little stand with the numbers 1, 2, and 3.
87.6	N/A	And then the first game show member asks number 1 why they decided to be a con artist with all their talent, and the first person responds, that it was really about dollars and cents and that they wanted to make money and this is how they saw that they could make money.
94.6	N/A	And then she asked the second person, who the person was, the second person was Leonardo di Caprio, who the person was that caught Frank eventually and he says that it was the, I don't know if he was the attorney general or he works for the US attorney, Carl Haverford or something like that?
104.6	N/A	Um and then it turns into a scene in France, in Marseilles, um on Christmas Eve and I think it was like in 1969, or something?
126.6	N/A	And the, Tom Hanks is trying to convince the French police officers to let him see Frank in this prison.
147.6	N/A	And so they let him see Frank and it's raining outside and then they come inside and they let him see Frank.
157.6	N/A	Um but he has to sit outside his prison cell and like only talk to him through a little slit.
169.6	N/A	And he's instructed not to hand him anything.
169.6	N/A	Um and then the police officer tells a guard in French to stay and watch.
177.6	N/A	Um and um so Tom Hanks opens his umbrella, or Carl, the detective or attorney general person, um and he opens his umbrella because I guess the ceiling is leaking and he's trying to talk to Frank.
185.6	N/A	And he's trying to read him um rules about extradition.
188.6	N/A	And Frank in his cell was trying to tell Carl to help him and he says he looks really sick, and um Hank, Tom Hanks tells Frank that he's not gonna trick him.
195.6	N/A	But eventually Frank falls over, and then Tom Hanks yells and calls for a doctor.
213.6	N/A	And so then they, the police officers get Frank out of his cell and take him to some, sort of like a hospital ward room.
220.6	N/A	And they lay him down.
234.6	N/A	And then the officers all go over to a sink to wash their hands for fear of lice and uh Tom Hanks asks when the doctor's gonna get there and the chief police officer I guess tells him that the doctor won't be here until the next day.
234.6	N/A	And Tom Hanks objects to this.
242.6	N/A	And then as he's objecting, the chief police officer turns, and then there's a door that has been left open, and then he goes to check the bed that they put Frank in that was surrounded by curtains, and he splits the curtains apart and Frank is gone.
252.6	N/A	And so he instructs his officers to go after him, um and then the scene turns to basically like a general prison population and they're all really excitable and excited because Frank is sort of running and trying to get away.
254.6	N/A	But because he's really sick he doesn't make it really far.
271.6	N/A	And he sort of stumbles on the floor and starts crawling.
273.6	N/A	And then the police officers and Tom Hanks are walking towards him.
290.6	N/A	And eventually the police officer puts a gun to Frank's head and Frank stops.
308.6	N/A	And then he turns around and falls on his back.
312.6	N/A	And then he says to Tom Hanks, or Carl, I think his name is, um, all right, let's go home.
316.6	N/A	And then there's some talking and then the scene ends.
320.6	N/A	Um the next scene is called The Boyfriend and, no the Record and this is a cartoon and there is a woman who was about to eat some pizza, a box of pizza and then her doorbell rings and then outside the doorbell there's an envelope and she picks it up and she opens it.
326.6	N/A	"And it's a record called ""a single life."""
330.6	N/A	And she puts the record on and it starts playing and as it starts playing she finds, she's holding a slice of pizza and when she's about to put it in her mouth she finds that it's like already eaten.
338.6	N/A	And then she realizes it has to do with the record.
343.6	N/A	And so when she spins the record one way, the pizza becomes whole again and when she spins it another way, it sort of shortens.
343.6	N/A	And so then she spins it all the way and all the pizza is gone.
343.6	N/A	And then she decides to take the sort of spinning thing off the record player and put it back on.
343.6	N/A	And then she's taken to a new scene um which I guess is a new time in her life.
360.6	N/A	And in the scene she's pregnant.
364.6	N/A	Um she has a little baby bump.
364.6	N/A	And she sort of plays with the record again, making her baby bump bigger and smaller.
364.6	N/A	And then she spins it all the way and then her baby is born.
379.6	N/A	Um and the baby's kind of crying.
382.6	N/A	Um and then she uh messes with the record player again.
392.6	N/A	And this time, she is a little girl with a doll and then she messes with the record player again and this time she is like an old lady in wheelchair, an older woman in a wheelchair with like a foot in a cast and she doesn't I guess like this scene.
397.6	N/A	And she tries to change it again, but each time she tries to change it, I know she like knocks the record player, like the bench over with, or the table over, with her foot in the cast.
407.6	N/A	And so it takes her multiple attempts to change the record player.
414.6	N/A	And then the next scene she's a really old elderly woman and she has to use a walker.
416.6	N/A	Um and so she uses the walker to change the scene again and um this time, she becomes an urn, and essentially the scene kind of ends there.
418.6	N/A	And then the next scene is the Boyfriend.
422.6	N/A	"And the words ""high maintenance"" come onto the scene, come onto the screen."
425.6	N/A	And then it turns to a scene where a woman and presumably her boyfriend are sitting across the table, eating dinner and apparently it's their valentine, sorry anniversary.
428.6	N/A	Um and she is sort of trying to make light conversation with him and she seems somewhat dissatisfied.
434.6	N/A	So he's sort of eating very meticulously and not really paying attention to her.
434.6	N/A	She gets up and tries to pour him some wine and he declines, and she's sort of frustrated by that and then he says that the asparagus is really tender and she mentions that it's an aphrodisiac, um that people say that it's an aphrodisiac, or they say.
456.6	N/A	And he asks, you know, who says that?
470.6	N/A	And she says, just people.
475.6	N/A	And um so then he decides to light a cigarette and she gets really upset with him and tells him not to light a cigarette in her house and she takes away his cigarette and then um puts it in the ash tray.
483.6	N/A	And then he just lights another one.
483.6	N/A	And she gets really frustrated with him and says that basically this is not how she planned on spending her anniversary, uh getting smoke in her apartment and having stilted conversation, and mechanical sex.
499.6	N/A	And she feels really bad for saying that last part, so she goes over to him and like sits in his lap and hugs him and sort of starts rubbing his neck.
503.6	N/A	And then when she's doing that, and they're sort of like ominous music playing, um, and when she does that also, I don't know if this matters, but to describe in detail, they're both in white people, and she has short brown hair, and he has short brown hair as well.
510.6	N/A	Um and then when she's hugging him she turns off a switch behind his neck, and then she goes over to her computer, and is on a website I think it's called Prometheus, and I guess there's a bunch of robot men. 11:56 Um and so she finds the man that she wants, the new man she wants, who is like a masseuse, a masseur, who is giving a massage, and who has longer hair, and a beard.
522.6	N/A	And so she calls up I guess the uh robotics company and tells them she hasn't been satisfied with her product, the 100 series.
532.6	N/A	And they ask her what's wrong, and she says he lacks ambition and something else and adventure.
538.6	N/A	And they say that's a typical problem with the 100 series and ask her if she would like to upgrade and she says yes.
538.6	N/A	And they ask her if she has an idea of like what she'd like to upgrade to and she says, yes.
557.6	N/A	She started to list a couple options at first, and then eventually gets to the one that she actually wants, but she said she'd like him to have shorter hair and less of a beard, like more of a five o'clock shadow and um but yeah, she basically describes a guy giving the massage who likes rock-climbing.
559.6	N/A	So um the robotics people come to her apartment and deliver, presumably apartment, um, and deliver the new robot she ordered.
561.6	N/A	And they, there's two um identical I think blonde women who come to deliver the new robot and then they take away the old robot.
581.6	N/A	But before, as they're like leaving on the elevator, uh the woman gets on the elevator and gives the old robot a kiss and takes off the ring off his ring finger and then she goes back to the apartment and puts the ring on her new robot boyfriend.
583.6	N/A	Um and so then she turns him on, and they're sitting at the dinner table again.
598.6	N/A	She offers him some wine, and he says that he can't have any because he has a climb the next day.
609.6	N/A	And she seems a little distraught, disappointed by that but then he mentions that the asparagus is very well-tended to or something and then he says that people mention that it's an aphrodisiac, and she says, who says that, and he says, just people.
627.6	N/A	And then she, he stands up and walks over to her, and starts giving her a massage and asks her how her day was, and she recounts her day back to him.
627.6	N/A	She says how she goes into town, went into town to get stuff for her meal and then she had a light lunch with somebody and I guess ran some other errands.
627.6	N/A	And then as he's massaging her, he turns off her, the switch behind the back of her neck, and then he goes and sits on the couch and turns on the TV and then lights a cigarette and that's is the end.
643.6	N/A	And then, so there's the record, the boyfriend, um, there's um another scene.
658.6	N/A	Oh the shoe.
668.6	N/A	"Um so the scene begins with the words ""how it ended up here"" or ""how it got here"" or something like that relating to the shoe."
676.6	N/A	And then it opens into a street and a man is leaning against a car wearing the shoes that were pictured and um he's looking across the street at a woman in a red skirt and then the person who owns the car that he's leaning against comes out.
683.6	N/A	And he sort of uh tells the guy leaning against his car to you know go away.
691.6	N/A	So the guy gets off the street and he gets onto the sidewalk.
712.6	N/A	And he stumbles as he's walking, and then the woman across the street that he was looking at um imitates him and so he realizes that she's imitating him and sort of, they start kinda going back and forth and so he makes the motions and she imitates him.
723.6	N/A	And then eventually she makes the motions and he imitates her.
723.6	N/A	And then they keep doing this sort of for a block, and then they get to an intersection and because he's really focused on imitating her, he doesn't realize that a car is coming and she tries to warn him, but he doesn't realize and thinks that they're still sort of playing the game.
737.6	N/A	So he's just going, and then, he, the car that's coming crashes into him, and he is sort of catapulted into the air, and the car is also catapulted into the air, and it sort of flips in the air and lands and it's sort of all cracked and destroyed.
737.6	N/A	And he, his shoe comes off when he is hit by the car and it ends up right next to the sidewalk, um, and then there's the camera shows another similar shoe, black shoe, and I think that's how the first few videos end.
737.6	N/A	The second set of videos are like, were very confusing to me.
754.6	N/A	Oh and then there's the, so there's Keith Reynolds.
764.6	N/A	"This is like sort of a stick figure cartoon and he shows up in a car and the words ""Keith Reynolds won't be here today"" show up on the screen and then the narration begins."
771.6	N/A	So Keith Reynolds parks his car in front of a building and he gets out, then he goes back to his car and grabs a blue hat, and he goes into the building, and we're told that Keith is expecting a promotion, 'cause he's the most senior junior worker and he goes up to the fifth floor where a girl he likes, I think her name is Sarah, is working.
788.6	N/A	And he hands her a cup, he makes her coffee every day even though she doesn't want it and he's hoping that this promotion will get her to like him.
788.6	N/A	So he hands her the coffee, which she throws out the window, and the coffee ends up landing on I guess a window cleaner stick figure who ends up falling down the building and then Bill in HR sees someone tumbling down the side of the building and calls for an ambulance, and then meanwhile Keith goes, while Keith is getting up to the 7th floor where he'll, where he expects to receive a promotion, Patrick is in an office with someone and he shakes somebody's hand, and leaves the office and then goes down to where Sarah is to tell her the good news. 19:11 And then meanwhile Keith goes up to the floor expecting a promotion and a strong handshake, but instead, he gets, the handshake is, turns out to be weak and he doesn't get the promotion.
799.6	N/A	Um so he decides he's gonna go down and see if Sarah will still like him, but when he gets down there, he sees that Patrick and Sarah are actually kissing, and while he was upstairs, Patrick and Sarah were like hugging and Patrick had told Sarah the good news.
810.6	N/A	Um so he gets down and he sees that them kissing, and Keith is really upset.
810.6	N/A	Then Patrick asked him to hold the elevator, which he does, um and then it seems, well not by choice, because while they were kissing, it seems like the elevator is taking a really long time to close, um, and then Patrick gets onto the elevator, and Keith is so mad, that um, something happens, that leads Keith to punch Patrick in the face, and then Keith keeps punching Patrick in the face, and eventually he hits him with his briefcase and he ends up killing Patrick.
843.6	N/A	And so he panics, and he has to get um Keith's body, or hide Keith's body, so he gets, without anybody seeing him.
845.6	N/A	So he gets off the elevator, Keith gets off the elevator with Patrick's body, and then Ruth I guess her name is, um is going up to the 7th floor because that's where her favorite bathroom is.
856.6	N/A	And she takes the stairs instead of the elevator, because she like had resolved to do so, and when she takes the stairs, she sees Keith with Patrick's body, and she faints and tumbles down the stairs, and then Keith has to, Keith keeps going.
856.6	N/A	Um and he runs into Sarah who also faints, and I'm not quite sure how the story ends.
856.6	N/A	Um and then, uh sort of the stories after this are very confusing and I don't really remember which, where which story ended.
875.6	N/A	But there was the post-card love story, um, where, which starts up with a scene of two people by a printer, a photocopier, a girl and a guy, and they're both photocopying things, and they're, there's like a divider between them.
883.6	N/A	And um so they both go back to their desk, and the guy sees, has a little note on his desk, and I think it's from the girl, I don't remember exact details.
887.6	N/A	But eventually he decides to make an entire mural out of post cards with both their faces and I think they're like kissing or something and it's this huge mural, and she walks in, and she sees the mural, and he stops and looks at her, and she's like incredibly you know happy about the mural, so that's that.
887.6	N/A	Um there's a really confusing story where uh there's someone who's like sort of teaching magic, and I don't really recall much about this story but eventually two people get shot, shoot at each other and then this guy recites this spell that turns this other guy into a dog.
887.6	N/A	And the guy who recited the spell shoots at a woman, who I guess shot at him back, and so the woman and him are both laying on the floor dead.
904.6	N/A	And then the guy who turned into a dog starts crawling on his hands and barking alongside a road and then he runs into another woman who is also under the spell, and pretending to be a dog.
910.6	N/A	And then they sort of play around with each other and bark at each other, and then they keep crawling for some time.
910.6	N/A	Yeah that's pretty much most of what I can recall.
930.6	N/A	I'm done.
