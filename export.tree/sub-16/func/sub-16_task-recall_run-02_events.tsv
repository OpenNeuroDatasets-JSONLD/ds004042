7.7	10.0	Okay, so I'm gonna start again, so I left off at a clip with two guys who communicate through post-its, 
17.7	17.0	so she just got back to her office upstairs and I think opens a window or opens a cabinet door and finds this cute sun made out of yellow post-its and realizes that it was this, 
33.7	8.0	the guy that she met at the printer that she left the blue post-it smiley face for, and that's really cute.
41.7	18.0	I forget if there's any other exchanges in between, but then we cut to her, to the girl going to the supply room and, at the office, and she sort of rummages through the supply room and gets, gathers all of the post-it decks that she can find.
59.7	7.0	We assume that she's doing that to kind of have, to make something bigger and greater than before.
66.7	12.0	So she takes all of these, she can barely carry them, walks out of the supply room, and as she walks out from the supply room, we see the camera sort of panning out, 
77.7	12.0	and in front of her is this entire wall-sized artwork made of post-its that shows the guy and her,
89.7	12.0	just the heads and maybe like some clouds or some sun or some sky stuff above, but it's just sort of heads like leaning against each other and sort of smiling in a cute way, 
100.7	14.0	and then we see the guy kind of crouch down and putting the finishing touches and sticking more post-its to this artwork, and she's obviously like super surprised and happy to happen to see this, 
113.7	13.0	"and he kind of turns around and smiles like, ""Yup, I did this,"" and I think, yeah, looks like a happy ending clip."
125.7	3.0	This is where this one ends.
128.7	9.0	I think this was, the clip before was the Black Hole one, also in an office, so very different atmosphere.
136.7	4.0	It's kind of late at night, and the light is off.
140.7	16.0	You see this guy, like clearly like pretty frustrated, working late, and he's at the printer printing something out, and what he prints is this sort of like large size, like not what he wanted, 
155.7	15.0	like this large size picture of just a giant black circle, and he takes it out, takes it out from the printer, and kind of does other stuff with the printer,
169.7	15.0	but then he sort of frustratingly throws his coffee cup, puts his coffee cup on the table where this picture is that he had laid down before, and he notices the coffee cup basically disappears inside this black circle.
184.7	9.0	He's obviously very confused about what's going on and kind of tentatively tries to put his hand in.
192.7	13.0	You can hear this sort of distinct, distinct wheezing noise, sounds like something out of Star Wars, sounds like there's something weird and supernatural about this print.
206.7	17.0	He has the idea of, well after he puts his hand inside this, this hole, this hole made by this black circle, he has the idea to go to the vending machine and to press the print against the vending machine, 
223.7	7.0	and he puts his hand through it and realizes that he can actually take out all of the, all of the, he can take out the candy.
229.7	15.0	So this circle has the property that wherever you put it, it basically removes all the obstacles between, between you and whatever thing was behind the obstacle.
244.7	4.0	So he gets kind of greedy, he takes out all of these Snickers bars.
248.7	14.0	He's kind of a weird guy, and he starts sort of snarfing down this Snickers bars, and then we see this sort of mischievous light come onto his face.
262.7	5.0	He goes to a door left of the office.
266.7	19.0	He places the, the print against the door, opens the door, we realize this door was locked, and then behind the door we see a safe, so we realize he's trying to go steal money.
284.7	4.0	He's probably working in some kind of a bank or insurance office or something.
289.7	22.0	He places the print against the safe door and starts pulling out, puts his hand through and starts pulling out wads of cash, more and more wads of cash, but then he again gets super greedy just like he did with the, with the candy, 
310.7	17.0	and he kind of puts his hand too far away, and he accidentally, he falls inside the safe, and he falls with his entire body, and he can't get out, and because he's not holding the print anymore, we see the print, this hole is falling down to the floor, 
326.7	8.0	so the portal between the safe and the outside has disappeared, and he gets locked in the safe.
333.7	13.0	Then the camera pans out, and we just hear him kind of like desperately hitting, hitting the safe walls, but he's now locked inside the safe, and I think that's where the clip ends.
347.7	5.0	Okay, and I think there's one more left, definitely the weirdest one of all.
352.7	16.0	So we're at this bus stop in what looks like Central New Jersey, based on the fact that we see New York in the background and the Freedom Tower, and we see this guy, and he's listening to music.
368.7	4.0	He's wearing like white headphones.
372.7	11.0	It's very warm outside, he's pretty sweaty, and he has a bag that we realize is full of strawberry ice cream that's kind of melting, 
383.7	8.0	and as he's waiting for his bus, there's no one else around except that this black SUV pulls over on the other side of the road, 
392.7	18.0	and we see the door open, and there's this woman who walks out of the SUV with curly red hair and wearing these like tights and kind of like floral coats and I think high heels, 
411.7	7.0	and she walks out of the car, looks kind of frustrated, walks around for a little bit.
418.7	5.0	This guy that, just observes her as she, as she paces around.
424.7	10.0	She's obviously pretty distressed, she forgets to put on the brake, the handbrake, so the car kind of starts spinning with the door open.
433.7	3.0	She doesn't seem to care about that.
435.7	9.0	She makes her way towards our guy, who's waiting at the bus stop and asks to use his cell phone.
444.7	6.0	"He's like, ""Yeah, sure,"" so she uses his cell phone to make a phone call."
449.7	5.0	She's really angry with whoever, to whoever's she's talking to.
455.7	11.0	"I think she's asking, she says something like, ""Oh, what, what did you do to her? How could you?"" like obviously really angry, has this conversation, "
465.7	13.0	and then at the end of the conversation, she smashes the phone to the ground, to this guy's dismay and surprise, and he's obviously too tired, too hot to argue with her, 
477.7	6.0	"but he's like, ""Lady, can you kind of please give me back something like sixty dollars for this phone?"""
482.7	23.0	She doesn't seem to care, and then the camera pans over to, to this bridge that we realize is nearby, and we see a car approaching, and the car stops, and out of the car walks this guy, walks out this guy, tall guy, a little bit bald.
505.7	11.0	He looks like he's wearing a suit, maybe suspenders, white shirt, and he's got this long face, big bulgy eyes.
515.7	4.0	He's kind of funny looking, clearly knows the woman.
518.7	8.0	The woman starts talking to him, and he seems to be the guy that she was calling.
526.7	11.0	He's trying to be apologetic, but then he gets really angry when he realizes that the woman told this guy at the bus stop, who was just observing the whole thing, who he was.
537.7	12.0	We learn about him that he was a magician or something, or the guy at the bus stop recognizes him as the magician at the casino, and then things get really weird.
549.7	9.0	"For whatever reason, this magician guy, oh so I should say this, the lady like keeps asking him, ""What did you do to her? What happened to her?"""
557.7	20.0	We don't know who she is, but at this point, she, so we focus on the magician, trying to remember when, I think the lady first pulls a gun out, pulls a gun on the magician, and the magician also pulls a gun on her.
576.7	11.0	He kind of makes this magic trick happen, pulls out this small, what looks like a toy gun but is probably a real gun, and then the guy at the bus stop, who is still observing this whole thing, is obviously very confused.
586.7	10.0	We see this image of him just kind of standing between the two of them as they point guns at each other, and then the lady starts walking towards the car.
596.7	18.0	The magician pulls out some kind of box and starts talking to the, to the guy at the bus stop and tries to basically pull some magic trick on him.
613.7	15.0	It's not, I'm trying to remember exactly what he does, but he says some words, sound like an incantation, opens the box, and in the box, as he does this, 
627.7	10.0	we sort of have this weird angle where he's above, he's standing above the guy at the bus stop, and the guy at the bus stop gets more and more confused.
636.7	14.0	We don't see exactly what happens to him, but we see what he sees, which is this box with this skin of something, maybe like the skin or this fossil or some sort of weird object that looks like a human in a fetal position.
649.7	9.0	I don't know exactly what it was, can't pinpoint it, and we cut out of that scene, or we're still in the same scene, 
657.7	12.0	but we cut out to the lady, and the lady goes to the car, opens the trunk, and in the trunk finds something or someone that gets her really, really upset,
669.7	16.0	"and she walks away from the trunk with her gun and points the gun at the magician, and the magician's like, ""Really? Are you gonna shoot me?"" and sure enough, she actually does shoot him, "
685.7	16.0	and the magician, with kind of his last breath, he collapses on the pavement, like clearly he's bleeding, he's gonna die soon, but he manages to pull out his own little gun and shoots the woman, and yeah so they're both dead, 
701.7	12.0	and we finally get to see what happened to the poor guy at the bus stop, and we realize that what happened to him, he's basically led to believe, or turned into a dog.
712.7	12.0	He's still human, but he barks, and he walks on his, on his all fours, and he starts walking toward the car, barking and acting like a dog, 
723.7	19.0	and out of the trunk comes this young woman, this like young, brunette woman we can only assume is the woman that the now dead red-headed woman was talking about on the phone, and she's barking as well, so she's also acting like a dog.
742.7	9.0	She and the guy at the bus stop are now dogs, or think of themselves as dogs and start kind of sniffing each other,
750.7	17.0	and then we just see them both walking on all of their, walking on their all fours, heading out, heading out into the sunlight of the great New York City skyline, and that's about it for this one.
768.7	2.0	I'm trying to remember.
770.7	4.0	I think, I think I got all of them, yeah.
775.7	4.0	Yeah, I think that's all that I can remember for now.
