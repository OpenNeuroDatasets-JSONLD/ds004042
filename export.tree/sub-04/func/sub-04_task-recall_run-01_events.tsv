6.9	N/A	Okay so one of the movies was called the Shoe.
10.9	N/A	The shoe started with a sneaker um that I think was Velcro, blue, uhh lying in the gutter and it was lying sideways.
21.9	N/A	It turned right side up and started tapping.
25.9	N/A	And there was a little subtitle before this that said how they get there.
29.9	N/A	Um and this guy is walking down the street and he looks at a girl across the street from him and he notices that she’s mimicking him.
39.9	N/A	He like reaches up and touches something, and she does the same and then uh, or it first, first he trips, and she trips, mimicking him, and then reaches up and touches something and she does the same.
52.9	N/A	Then they start doing all these, like bending down gestures with their hands um being silly, copying each other.
61.9	N/A	And then she sees that he’s gonna walk into the street continuing to mimic her.
68.9	N/A	And she starts to warn him with her hands, not saying anything, just like making scary hand gestures.
77.9	N/A	And he just keeps mimicking them, and then walks right in front of this car, which is like an old brown sedan.
87.9	N/A	And he smashes the windshield and um it gets launched into the air and lands really far away after like a long slow motion shot of the car in the air.
101.9	N/A	And then he uh, the guy gets launched and his shoe flies into the air, this is the guy who was being mimicked.
112.9	N/A	And then his shoe lands in the gutter and the shoe like is in the position that the shoe was in in the beginning of the movie.
120.9	N/A	And the camera pans and you see an older black shoe also in the gutter.
125.9	N/A	So now you know how shoes get in the gutter.
128.9	N/A	Um there was one called the Record where this cartoon girl who looks like a broomstick with orange hair uh gets a record in the mail and she puts the record on and notices that her pizza is disappearing.
145.9	N/A	And then she stops the record and rewinds it, and the pizza comes back and she plays with that.
151.9	N/A	Um and then she like speeds it up and skips to a different part of the record entirely and then finds that she’s in completely new surroundings in a, um.
166.9	N/A	Before she was like in a dorm, um, on like a futon kind of thing, and now she’s in a pretty nice house with this like fancy yellow chair next to her and she’s well-dressed and she’s pregnant.
178.9	N/A	And she moves the record back and forth and sees the size of her belly changing and then gets to having a baby.
185.9	N/A	And then she looks a little miffed because she doesn’t really want to deal with a baby.
189.9	N/A	Um she goes back in time and she’s holding a doll; she’s a kid.
194.9	N/A	And then, she like can’t really reach the record anymore, um so she like tries to reach up and she bumps it and it takes her forward way into the future, and now she’s in a wheelchair.
212.9	N/A	She has like a broken leg and uh she keeps trying to move the record, but it keeps skipping um.
221.9	N/A	Finally, she moves the record, like the reason she’s having trouble is because she’s in the wheelchair and she can’t get close enough.
227.9	N/A	It keeps skipping.
228.9	N/A	Eventually she moves it and then she’s like even older in that house and she has a walker.
236.9	N/A	And then um she, let’s see, she moves it.
242.9	N/A	I can’t remember if she moves it even further forward, but then it skips again.
249.9	N/A	Oh she falls over the walker and then the needle jumps and then she’s um in an urn. She’s dead.
259.9	N/A	Um there was a Catch me if you can clip that started off with a show, game show called To tell the truth, with big like a golden title card opens up and um three guys come out and they all say that their name is Frank William Abignail Junior.
285.9	N/A	Uhh there’s like a brown haired dude, a short brown-haired dude, then Leonardo di Caprio having like floppy hair, and then a taller guy.
296.9	N/A	And you’re told that you’re gonna like meet, it’s a game show, the game show host says like that he’s introducing one of them is a con man.
306.9	N/A	And they all claim to be that con man.
308.9	N/A	Um and then they’re all like standing there in a line saying that they’re that guy.
314.9	N/A	Then they go sit down and they start fielding questions from the game show host.
318.9	N/A	The first guy fields one, uh I forget what it was.
322.9	N/A	The second guy, which is Leonardo di Caprio, the real guy, uh gets asked how he caught.
333.9	N/A	And then he starts to have a flashback after saying who caught him, which is Carl something played by Tom Hanks with the, those like hip glasses.
344.9	N/A	Um so the flashback goes to Tom Hanks standing outside a prison in Marseilles in 1969.
352.9	N/A	And it’s dark and he’s talking to some French people who let him in to see the cell with Leo in it.
362.9	N/A	And they say you know, they basically say, don’t try to get him out of here, don’t go into the cell, don’t pass him anything through this little slot that we open up for you.
373.9	N/A	He sits down and he looks in and we see um Leonardo who we know from the game show had done a bunch of things by the time he was 19.
384.9	N/A	He had like committed 4 million dollars worth of fraudulent transactions in 26 states, 26 countries and all 50 states.
392.9	N/A	Uh and we see him, he’s got this like nasty long hair and a neck beard and a terrible cough.
401.9	N/A	And uh um Carl is not really buying it at first, and um Leo keeps coughing and looking miserable.
412.9	N/A	And Carl is reading him some legal documents, reading them too fast to understand, um.
417.9	N/A	And then, Leo is really, really selling this I’m sick, I need to get out of here thing, and eventually he collapses.
427.9	N/A	And uh yeah Tom Hanks throws his chair and stands up and says we need a doctor.
433.9	N/A	Um and eventually they start dragging Leo who’s continuing to act all sick um, I mean he really is sick, but he’s acting extra sick.
446.9	N/A	So they’re dragging him to some bed, they throw him in the bed.
451.9	N/A	Carl is demanding that he get put on a plane.
455.9	N/A	And the French people like get him in the bed and then just start washing their hands and saying they’re getting rid of all the lice uh and that you know he’s not, they're not, he's gonna get a doctor tomorrow when the doctor comes in.
470.9	N/A	Um and they’re saying they’re not going to take him to the US.
473.9	N/A	And Carl says I’ve worked you hard to have you take this away from me now.
477.9	N/A	But then one of the French people notices that the door is open and throws the curtains to where the bed with uh Abignail Junior was supposed to be and he’s gone.
490.9	N/A	And he’s dragging himself down the corridor of the prison and he’s looking really, really raggedy and crawling on the ground.
501.9	N/A	And uh all the prisoners are like slamming on the gate, what’s it fence, and cheering and yelling.
512.9	N/A	And um Carl and all the French officials walk down the hall and one puts a gun to Leo’s head.
522.9	N/A	And Leo throws up his arms and lies down on the ground and kind of like smiles in a resigned way.
532.9	N/A	And Tom Hanks says something like, “Oh, Frank.”
537.9	N/A	And I think that’s the end of that clip.
542.9	N/A	What else.
551.9	N/A	There was the weird creepy robot thing where it was this couple having like a way overly stilted dinner conversation.
562.9	N/A	They’re at the end of a long dinner table, it's a you know they look like they’re in their late 30s or early 40s maybe.
574.9	N/A	And um the man is well-dressed and, well they’re both really well-dressed and there’s like a really nice dinner table set up and.
585.9	N/A	Um, they’re having asparagus and um she says um let’s see.
598.9	N/A	She asks if he wants, she walks over with wine, first to pour him a glass of wine.
603.9	N/A	He covers the glass, says you know I can’t have wine when I’m on call.
607.9	N/A	She goes back to her seat, she says you’re just a computer analyst, you’re not a surgeon, you can drink a little, it’s our anniversary.
618.9	N/A	He um isn’t happy with that and he puts on, he smokes a cigarette.
627.9	N/A	And she takes the cigarette from him and she says that you can’t smoke in my house, gets really upset.
633.9	N/A	She says like oh yeah this is exactly what I wanted, passive smoke on my anniversary, and maybe some stilted conversation and then if I’m really lucky, some mechanical sex.
645.9	N/A	And um he kind of looks robotic and like it looks like she’s trying her best to hurt his feelings by saying something mean and he’s trying his best to show that he doesn’t feel anything that she says.
665.9	N/A	He says something about the asparagus being tender.
668.9	N/A	She says that it’s an aphrodisiac.
671.9	N/A	He asks, who says that and she says, oh it’s just something people say.
676.9	N/A	Um that was earlier I guess cuz it’s after the mechanical sex comment that she walks over to him and acts like she feels bad and sits in his lap and leans his head on her shoulder.
692.9	N/A	And then is like consoling him saying she’s sorry that she said that, and then she finds a little off switch on his neck and turns him off cuz he’s a robot and uh.
706.9	N/A	Then she takes out her computer, which is an apple macbook pro and looks at a website for a bunch of other of these robot lover things.
718.9	N/A	Um and she puts on a little earpiece and makes a phone call and orders um this one.
729.9	N/A	She orders one, well she says that her 100 unit is acting up because it lacks ambition.
739.9	N/A	And she asks for the 300 unit, well she asks for a rock-climber masseuse and like the one in the photo.
749.9	N/A	And so then these like two tall blond girls who look very alike knock on her door and deliver a new unit and take the old unit away.
761.9	N/A	And oh yeah, she says that the new unit shouldn’t have a beard but it could have some 5 o’clock shadow.
768.9	N/A	And um so they take the old unit away and she’s like oh wait a second and she kisses him.
775.9	N/A	He’s like in a Annabel Lecter style like, not really.
780.9	N/A	But he’s in a dolly like leaned up against it.
784.9	N/A	They take him away.
787.9	N/A	So then yeah she takes his wedding ring, puts it on her new guy, sits him in a chair, boots him up.
795.9	N/A	He doesn’t want to drink because he has a big climb tomorrow which is too reminiscent of the old guy.
801.9	N/A	And then um he walks over to her and starts giving her a massage and she’s so happy.
810.9	N/A	And then he finds, oh he says the thing about the asparagus.
814.9	N/A	They say it’s an aphrodisiac, she says who says, he says just something they say.
818.9	N/A	Then he starts giving her the massage.
820.9	N/A	She’s so happy.
821.9	N/A	Then he turns her off switch and goes and sits in the couch and smokes a cigarette, drinks a beer, and watches TV.
830.9	N/A	Um let’s see.
843.9	N/A	There’s a nice silver saucer on the table during that one.
876.9	N/A	So then there was a, the post-it love one where there are two people who um.
890.9	N/A	I forget how it became clear that they were interested in each other, but she leaves a post it of a smiley face in a closed folder on his desk and he really likes that.
906.9	N/A	And then they have this escalating exchange of leaving post-it notes around for each other in different patterns which culminates in him.
917.9	N/A	She like goes to the storage closet to get all the post-it notes, and then walks down the hall, and she sees that he’s already um put up a big giant post-it of their faces.
932.9	N/A	And there’s a bunch of hearts coming out of it.
935.9	N/A	I guess some of the intervening ones were like uhh.
940.9	N/A	Yeah so she does that smiley face, then he does uh um an orange sun which she notices when she raises the blinds.
949.9	N/A	And then she does a like flower heart or something on the, I think it’s a flower on the bathroom stall which he sees when he’s looking in the mirror.
960.9	N/A	And then he does uhh something on the wall with the storage closet which is where she gets all the post it notes.
970.9	N/A	And then she sees him making those faces and she’s smiling and happy because of that.
981.9	N/A	Uh there was another one about romance which starred stick figures named Keith Reynolds and Patrick Campbell.
989.9	N/A	Keith Reynolds goes to his office thinking that he’s getting a promotion.
996.9	N/A	He’s like a tall blue stick figure, gets out of this car, walks into this building, goes up to, I don’t know, I forget if it’s the 4th or the 7th floor.
1008.9	N/A	Um oh yeah, so first he’s imagining going up to the 7th floor to shake hands and sign with a gold pen his promotion.
1022.9	N/A	On the way up to the 7th floor he stops at the 4th floor, where he sees this shapely pink stick figure bending over.
1032.9	N/A	He’s in love with her.
1033.9	N/A	He’s trying to get her to love him and want to marry him by giving her coffee even though she doesn’t want coffee every day.
1040.9	N/A	Um so he gives her some coffee and then he uh.
1048.9	N/A	He goes up the um elevator to the 7th floor.
1053.9	N/A	Meanwhile, the pink lady who he loves, pours the coffee out the window onto somebody’s head, who falls down.
1062.9	N/A	The guy below her sees her falling, checks that it’s a person, and not some thing, it's someone not something.
1072.9	N/A	And then he calls an ambulance.
1078.9	N/A	So meanwhile, Keith Reynolds is going up to the 7th floor where he is um about to see Patrick Campbell come out of the office.
1091.9	N/A	And Patrick Campbell has, is the one who’s actually gotten the promotion.
1095.9	N/A	And Keith Reynolds goes in and the handshake is not as firm as he was hoping and there’s not gold pen.
1102.9	N/A	And he’s very sad.
1107.9	N/A	And uhh I guess maybe it’s worth saying that this one is all narrated and they don’t talk at all, the characters.
1119.9	N/A	And then in the Shoe and the Record and the Post It one, also no one says anything.
1127.9	N/A	It’s just um, there’s no narration and there’s no dialogue.
1133.9	N/A	So anyways, in this one, so he doesn’t get the promotion, he goes down, it turns out Patrick Campbell and the pink girl whose name might be Sarah are a thing.
1147.9	N/A	And they’re kissing.
1150.9	N/A	He’s like telling her about the promotion.
1153.9	N/A	And um Keith is standing in the elevator wishing that the door would close because he had gone down to see how the pink lady was uh.
1164.9	N/A	He’d just gone down to see her kind of to like feel better after not getting the promotion.
1169.9	N/A	And he imagines what he would do if Patrick got in a small space with him.
1176.9	N/A	And then it actually happens cuz Patrick comes to the elevator after the elevator stays open for too long.
1182.9	N/A	And then they go back up to Patrick’s office and on the way out of the elevator, on Patrick’s way out of the elevator, Keith says, presumably, go fuck yourself, um three words he had never said to anyone before.
1199.9	N/A	And uh Patrick comes back to punch him in the face.
1204.9	N/A	And then Keith reciprocates and eventually punches him down to the ground.
1211.9	N/A	There’s like blood spraying around the elevator and then he beats his face in with the briefcase.
1221.9	N/A	And at this time, the woman downstairs who is, forget what her job is, but she’s coming up to use the bathroom cuz her favorite bathroom is on the 7th floor cuz of the soap is better.
1240.9	N/A	And so he starts dragging.
1246.9	N/A	Keith starts dragging dead Patrick down the stairs cuz he thinks that would be better than taking him down the elevator cuz he doesn’t want to run into anyone.
1255.9	N/A	And um so he’s bringing Patrick down the stairs, he runs into the woman who’s on her way up to use the bathroom.
1266.9	N/A	She sees him and the dead body and faints, and falls down the stairs and I guess dies.
1272.9	N/A	There’s blood for sure, there’s a cracking sound.
1276.9	N/A	Um and he, Keith, thinks you know it’s a genuine accident.
1284.9	N/A	Uh and what does he do?
1288.9	N/A	He starts dragging Patrick towards the window, doesn’t know what he’s doing yet, but he starts dragging him towards the window.
1298.9	N/A	And then um the woman who he’s in love with starts coming up because she wants to see Patrick.
1305.9	N/A	She’s bringing files to him but it’s just an excuse to see him.
1308.9	N/A	And then uh she ends up um seeing the dead body and also fainting and Keith thinks, I guess dead bodies have that effect on women.
1321.9	N/A	And then he decides to throw Patrick out the window.
1327.9	N/A	He’s gonna use that ladder that’s left over from the person who fell down because of the hot coffee.
1333.9	N/A	So then he kind of drops Patrick out the window and he’s starting to climb down and then he looks in the building and sees um.
1343.9	N/A	He sees the janitor who he’s never talked to before, and he thinks about um, and this is like, this is I guess not foreshadowed but like thematically related to earlier where he looks into the silver walls of the elevator and sees his own reflection.
1364.9	N/A	Here this time he sees the janitor, and he thinks about how in one second, you know even if you’re fighting for the job et cetera et cetera, um, and your life is going so well, then one second that can all change, as evidenced by Patrick.
1379.9	N/A	And he’s staring at this janitor and he just balances there for a while.
1384.9	N/A	And I think that’s the end of that clip.
1388.9	N/A	Um so then there’s the magician one.
1395.9	N/A	So in the one with the magician, what happens is, this dude in white headphones and a red t-shirt is standing around being sweaty looking kinda dopey waiting for the bus I guess.
1405.9	N/A	And this woman drives up in an SUV, gets out, leaves the door open, and leaves the car in drive.
1412.9	N/A	She’s barefoot and in like a, uh, leggings and a nightgown kind of thing, looking frazzled.
1419.9	N/A	She tries to use a payphone.
1421.9	N/A	The payphone doesn’t work.
1422.9	N/A	She paces around.
1423.9	N/A	She comes up to the dude.
1424.9	N/A	She asks him for, she can use his phone.
1427.9	N/A	It’s like a brick phone, like a blackberry or something.
1432.9	N/A	She uses it to call somebody, and she keeps yelling and saying she’ll involve the police.
1438.9	N/A	And then she gets really distraught and spikes the phone on the ground and it shatters.
1442.9	N/A	And the guy is, miss, uh, this phone is broken.
1448.9	N/A	Can you give me like 60 bucks?
1450.9	N/A	And she’s completely uninterested.
1453.9	N/A	And then a car pulls up, maybe two blocks away under an overpass and she says, that’s him.
1460.9	N/A	And she walks over to that car.
1464.9	N/A	And he’s following her because he wants the money for his phone.
1466.9	N/A	And there’s a lanky uh man who looks like he was well-dressed but has taken his shirt off, he’s wearing like suspenders and stuff and an untied bow tie.
1481.9	N/A	And um she keeps yelling, where is she?
1486.9	N/A	And then she pulls out a gun and points it at him.
1492.9	N/A	Um at the guy who we will eventually find out is the magician.
1497.9	N/A	She says where is she?
1500.9	N/A	And then the guy is like asking the red shirt guy who he is.
1504.9	N/A	He explains about the phone, uh he says, he asks uh if he recognizes him.
1511.9	N/A	The frazzled woman is like you know you’re so paranoid, of course he doesn’t recognize you.
1516.9	N/A	Red shirt guy is eventually like, oh, no, I do recognize you.
1520.9	N/A	You’re that magician.
1523.9	N/A	He even says him by name.
1525.9	N/A	And there’s this kind of like staredown while she’s pointing the gun at the magician.
1531.9	N/A	And he pulls out a little gun in a kind of magic trick sort of way.
1537.9	N/A	And um let’s see, she, it’s like a nice gun, he says something about its fancy origins and used by some other person.
1553.9	N/A	Then there’s a quiet moment and you hear like weird yelling, yelping coming from the trunk of this car that the man was leaned up against.
1562.9	N/A	And she goes and starts screwing around with the trunk and because the orange shirt, red shirt guy knows who the magician is, he pulls out this magic trick, this little tiny um.
1576.9	N/A	It’s a tiny little like coffin shaped thing with a cross on it and he starts reading it, some kind of a verse and it starts to stupefy and hypnotize the red shirt guy while the woman is futzing with the trunk.
1590.9	N/A	And then she finally gets the trunk open and is horrified by what she sees.
1594.9	N/A	And she walks over and she shoots the man who has, well okay, so first, the man has hypnotized this guy.
1605.9	N/A	Orange shirt guy’s ice cream has melted and he's like fallen on the floor and he’s kind of like convulsing, making dog noises.
1613.9	N/A	The magician goes like oh shit and reads, pulls out a piece of paper and reads the verse that he had been reading, and like corrects whatever mistake it was, realizes he read it wrong.
1627.9	N/A	And she comes, the frazzled woman comes over and shoots him and from the ground he shoots her.
1635.9	N/A	And they both are lying there as the guy who um was in the orange shirt gets up and starts to lick up the ice cream and starts to bark.
1647.9	N/A	And then you hear barking coming from somewhere else and he’s licking up this like pinkish strawberry ice cream.
1654.9	N/A	It is strawberry ice cream.
1656.9	N/A	Um and he, it was like he was holding it in a grocery bag.
1661.9	N/A	Uh and then it melted and he dropped it when he was hypnotized.
1664.9	N/A	Um he’s like licking it up from the ground and then he’s walking around on all fours, and this girl in like a dress, that kind of looks like a hospital gown, but isn’t I don’t think, walks over to him also on all fours.
1678.9	N/A	She was in the trunk.
1681.9	N/A	Um and they’re both barking and they kind of start playing.
1687.9	N/A	She like knocks him over, he waves his hands and feet in the air, like you know, I guess a dog would do that?
1695.9	N/A	Looks more like a roly poly.
1696.9	N/A	Uh and they kind of walk off together on their hands, on their knees and their hands.
1707.9	N/A	I feel like I’m still missing a clip so I'll think for a second...
1731.9	N/A	I assume let’s all go to the lobby wasn’t a probe, but that’s all I can think of.
1771.9	N/A	Okay, I think I’m done.
