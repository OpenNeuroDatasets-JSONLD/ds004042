3.5	3.0	Oh wait do I start talking now?
8.5	2.0	Okay.
9.5	4.0	Um, so let's see.
12.5	12.0	The first skit, uh, the first story, was called Catch Me If You Can, and it opens on the stage of a game show that looks like it's set in the 1970s.
24.5	7.0	And I think the show was called So you tell a lie?
30.5	10.0	And it's um shown on this kind of like billboard logo kind of Las Vegas style.
40.5	13.0	And it starts with a voiceover, a host is saying something about how um we're going to bring on stage one of the greatest impersonators through history.
53.5	21.0	And um that this guy had flown for, wait so before that, these three guys in airline pilot suits come out and they each introduce themselves as Frank something, I think it's Frank Anglesall.
74.5	20.0	And um the camera pans from each one to another as the voiceover says um this guy had impersonated a pilot for PanAm and flown like 300 miles or like 3000 miles for free.
94.5	14.0	And he did this at the same time as pretending to be a doctor at some like at like Mass General Hospital, um and that he had done all of this before the age of 19.
107.5	10.0	Oh before he says that he did this before the age of 19, he says he also stole like several million dollars and forged bills and checks.
118.5	5.0	And so then it goes to this old lady who asks some questions.
123.5	22.0	And she asks number one, um, the first impersonator number one, like, uh why did you do this `cause you're so smart, how did obviously, why did you put all this effort into impersonating people when you could just actually do something and become a doctor for real?
145.5	17.0	And the first pilot guy says that it was really a um, a calculated thing, which was that it was just uh dollars and cents, he used that phrase, and he thought that it was just the way he could make the most money with the least effort.
162.5	13.0	And then the lady asks the second impersonator who is acted by Leonardo di Caprio and she asked him, how did you get caught?
174.5	10.0	And he says he got caught by a um, this detective, I forget his name, Carl, I think.
184.5	13.0	And as he's, at the moment he says that, it flashes back to this um guy Carl who's this big old guy wearing a hat and a big trenchcoat.
197.5	13.0	And he's talking to a bunch of French police officers who were carrying umbrellas and he was telling them that he's like the American detective or the American police officer.
210.5	4.0	And he demands to see Frank the prisoner.
213.5	14.0	Um and eventually they take him down this into this like nasty prison, in uh Marseilles, I think on the screen it says Marseilles, 1947 or something like that.
228.5	16.0	And so then he arrives at this prison door and um the prison guard tells him uh you won't open this door, don't open this door, and he opens this little slot and he says, don't pass him anything through here.
243.5	5.0	You can sit here and talk to him but don't pass him anything through this grill.
248.5	19.0	So then he sits down and he looks inside through this grill, it looks like a shot of like this cell looking out at him and he tells the prisoner that he's been sent there by the U.S. Consulate or something to read him his rights under like extradition treaty.
266.5	15.0	He starts on Article 1, it's really boring, I don't remember what he says, but the prisoner inside, Frank, is coughing really hard and he's like wrapped up in these blankets and he's really dirty and has lots of like really long hair and like...and stuff.
282.5	11.0	And he's coughing and coughing and coughing and he says help me, help me, and um the police officer is like no don't do this to me, you know I can't, or whatever.
292.5	12.0	So then he says like stay with me, he starts with Article 2 and then the prisoner um starts coughing and then he collapses and it looks like he's dead or like in a coma.
303.5	6.0	And so the police officer gets really worried and he stands up and starts shouting, like Frank! Frank!
308.5	4.0	And then like shouts to the police officers that he needs a doctor, he needs a doctor.
312.5	10.0	And so they come and take him out and they bring him to the medical bay and um they wrestle him onto the bed where he looks like he's dying.
321.5	9.0	He's coughing and the police officer's like listen to me Frank, I'm gonna get you out of here, tomorrow we're going home, tomorrow we're going home, 
329.5	15.0	and then the chief of the prison and the guards are then washing their hands and he's like what's he doing, and the police officers said they're washing their hands so we don't get lice 
343.5	6.0	 and uh the police officer says he needs to see a doctor if he's coming back to America tomorrow, and the guy says um, the person says listen, um, the doctor's not coming until tomorrow, 
349.5	19.0	and so the police officer says ah this guy is coming back to America and he needs to see a doctor, if he dies it's on your head.
368.5	10.0	And then the prison ward then turns around, and the door is swinging, and they open the curtains, surrounding the bed, and it's empty.
378.5	16.0	And then it flashes to this long hallway in the prison full of cells, it's two stories and all the prisoners are shouting um because the prisoner Frank is running down it trying to escape.
393.5	4.0	But then he collapses and he just has to crawl.
396.5	6.0	And as he's crawling away, you can see the ward and the prison guards and the policeman going after him.
401.5	6.0	And eventually the ward catches up with him and he pulls out a gun, and he sticks it against Frank's head.
408.5	9.0	And so Frank like sits back on his knee and he raises his hands and says okay Carl, the police officer, take me home.
417.5	5.0	And then he collapses backwards on his back like spreadeagle and then the clip ends.
424.5	5.0	So then the next movie was called like the Single Life I think?
429.5	12.0	And it's a cartoon and there's this woman with like bright orange hair who's sitting on an armchair at a fuzzy old house.
441.5	11.0	Um and a package arrives at the door, so she goes and gets it, she opens it up and it's a record and the record is called um the single life.
451.5	6.0	And so she puts it into her record player and she sits down with a slice of pizza.
457.5	6.0	But then as it's playing, slowly the slice of pizza is like...it all disappears except for the crust.
463.5	6.0	And she's really confused and then she looks down at the record and spins it backwards.
468.5	2.0	The pizza reappears.
470.5	3.0	She scoots it forward, the pizza disappears again.
472.5	6.0	She does it several times and then she fast-forwards way ahead, or like a bit more.
477.5	7.0	And the pizza disappears and the red candle sitting on her bedside like burns all the way down.
483.5	3.0	And then she goes back and forth between that a couple times.
486.5	10.0	And then she's like uh she spins it really far, a lot, and then she's in a new house and it looks like kind of an upscale house.
496.5	8.0	And she's wearing like a fancy black dress and it looks like really well to-do, and she looks down at herself and it turns out she's pregnant.
504.5	4.0	And she's like really happy and there's a picture of her like getting married on the mantelpiece.
509.5	15.0	So then she gets a like, she has an expression on her face like she suddenly gets an idea, and she spins the record a whole bunch, like around around around really fast, and then suddenly she's not pregnant anymore, and there's a kid.
524.5	18.0	Um and then I don't remember exactly what happens to the kid, like the kid is annoyed with something, and so she spins the record way further and then uh suddenly she's old and in a wheelchair.
542.5	15.0	And um she tries to spin it forward but I guess her hands are shaking, so as she wheels forward and tries to spin it, it keeps resetting her to the beginning where she is just sitting there, so that happens over and over and over, 
556.5	5.0	until she gets a really determined look on her face, and she spins it, 
560.5	8.0	and then suddenly she's like an old lady and she's no longer in a wheelchair, but she has a walker.
568.5	11.0	And she's kind of confused about this and so she goes forward to the record player to move it again, but as she walks forward, she trips and falls.
579.5	19.0	And then um while she's lying on the ground, the record ends and um she dies and becomes a um ashes and then the needle on the record gets set on the side of the record player and it ends.
598.5	2.0	And that's the end of that one.
600.5	5.0	Um let's see.
604.5	11.0	And then I think the next one is another one that's like called the shoe or something like that.
614.5	22.0	And it starts with this guy, it starts with a shot of these worn-out shoes, and then it pans up to this uh milk carton, um, and he opens it like first opens it, and there's something like buying this milk and then he opens it and drinks it.
635.5	3.0	I kind of think this might be an ad for milk but I'm not sure.
639.5	15.0	And he's drinking it and he's leaning against a car and then the owner of the car comes out and he shouts at him so he um gets off the car and he's walking away, and he trips on like an uneven path of the sidewalk.
655.5	8.0	And then, as he trips, he sees a woman across the street also trip, it looks like she's tripping at nothing.
663.5	10.0	And so he's sipping his milk and like looking at her, and then uh let's see, he puts the milk up on the edge of a fence.
673.5	5.0	And the woman across the street, even though she doesn't have any milk also reaches up, and can see it.
677.5	4.0	Oh no so this was called like the Copy Cat.
682.5	17.0	Um and so then he starts walking like exaggeratingly funny, like swinging arms and bent over, and she copies him and then she disappears behind like a mailbox and she's now like really bent over, crazy, walking crazy.
698.5	3.0	He imitates her.
700.5	12.0	And they're imitating back and forth, and um, he's reaching the end of the street um towards the crosswalk but he's turned looking at her across the street.
712.5	11.0	And she tries to signal to him, stop, stop, stop, there's a car coming, don't enter the street and she's like waving her arms, but he doesn't understand and he's just copying her and he keeps walking forward.
723.5	2.0	And then he gets hit by a car.
725.5	3.0	And presumably he dies.
727.5	7.0	And um one of the shoes like flies off, it lands in the gutter.
733.5	7.0	And then the screen pans forward, we see another shoe, except it's like covered in bees or something.   
742.5	3.0	Um, let's see.
747.5	19.0	Uhh this is out of order now, but um, there was one that was called, something about like Ryan Reinharts and he's a cartoon and he's this really tall, blue stick figure with a hat on it 
766.5	11.0	and he enters this office building and there's a voiceover describing everything and said that this is a really, really important day for Ryan Reinholtz because he's been there for 8 days 
776.5	12.0	and this is the day that he's going to become a, uh, he's going to be promoted, because he's the most senior junior businessman.
789.5	9.0	Um so he enters the elevator, he goes up a floor to see this lady named Sarah that he has a crush on.
798.5	16.0	And he's imagining like this future with him with this special woman, who is a pink stick figure and what he does so like flirt with her but not very well, he just makes her a cup of coffee.
814.5	13.0	So he makes her a cup of coffee and gives it to her and he leaves to the elevator, but Sarah doesn't actually like coffee, and so she pours it out the window.
826.5	13.0	On the window there's a guy on a ladder, um who's like maybe washing windows or something, and so she dumps the hot coffee on him and he falls down.
838.5	4.0	And he falls down past this window of this HR guy.
841.5	3.0	And this HR guy is like what?
843.5	13.0	There's something or someone who fell down outside the window, and so he goes out to check, and he looks down and he figures out it was a someone who fell down, and so then he calls 911.
856.5	20.0	And then um meanwhile Ryan Reynolds is going up to the uh 7th floor and he's imagining what it's like to get his promotion, and like how there'll be this really firm handshake, and they'll give him this gold... 
875.5	7.0	pen to sign his name, to make him partner, and he'll look happy and everything.
882.5	16.0	Um and in the meantime um this other guy is coming down, um to see Sarah, um, to give her some good news he's got today and meanwhile back in the 7th floor with the bosses, 
897.5	17.0	the handshake is a little less firm than he expected, and there's no gold pen, then he gets told by the um two senior guys that someone else was promoted and he wouldn't be promoted.
915.5	11.0	And so meanwhile the other guy I think his name is Carl, is telling Sarah that he's been promoted, and they're like hugging and kissing and he's really excited that she's really happy for him, 
926.5	8.0	and you know Ryan's all like oh I'm sad, so he goes down the elevator, and he thinks oh maybe Sarah wants another cup of coffee.
934.5	15.0	But then when the elevator doors open, he sees um Carl and Sarah kissing, kissing with open mouths, and Ryan is like oh no, this elevator door seems to be open for a really long time, it's awkward.
949.5	6.0	And then Carl says oh can you hold the elevator for me, oh!
956.5	3.0	And he enters the elevator.
958.5	11.0	But before that actually, while Ryan is watching Carl and Sarah make out, he's picturing in his head what he'd like to do to Carl if he were in a small enclosed room with him.
970.5	9.0	So then conveniently Carl's in the elevator with him and Ryan gets upset and he says a three letter phrase to him, that he's never said before to anyone, 
979.5	15.0	and then he immediately regrets doing that because um Carl punches him in the face, and then Ryan overreacts, and he starts like beating him, and then Ryan's on the floor, on the ground, 
993.5	7.0	and he takes, Carl takes the briefcase, I'm sorry, Ryan takes the briefcase, and he smashes his head open.
1000.5	5.0	And then Ryan's like, oh no I've killed him, what should I do?
1007.5	17.0	And so he uh drags the body out of the elevator, oh no sorry, he's sitting in the elevator and then way back down on the first floor, the receptionist says I need to use the bathroom.
1023.5	12.0	And her favorite bathroom is up on like the 7th or 8th floor and she likes it the best because it has a slightly fancier hand soap dispenser.
1035.5	10.0	And so it sounds like she's going to go up to the elevator, but then she's like because of my new year's resolution, um, the elevator, she decides the stairs.
1045.5	11.0	And so that sounds like it's really good news, for Ryan who's still got Carl in the elevator, but Ryan has just decided to hide Carl's body at his house while he decides what to do with it, 
1055.5	12.0	but he's going to take the stairs so that if the elevator ever opens on the floor, he won't just be seen there, um caught red-handed, because people don't like murderers.
1067.5	16.0	And so he um is walking down the stairs dragging this body, and as they approach the 6th floor, the receptionist lady is there, and she sees Ryan dragging the body, and he's covered in blood.
1084.5	13.0	Oh! That reminds me. So while Ryan is killing Carl, um, he's thinking, I wonder if I wash this shirt soon enough, if I could get the bloodstains out.
1098.5	4.0	So anyways, he's on the stairs, covered in blood.
1101.5	4.0	The receptionist sees him, and she's like freaked out, and she faints.
1105.5	5.0	And she's on the stairs so she falls backwards on her head, and she dies.
1110.5	3.0	Um the narrator says um oh well that was a real accident.
1113.5	19.0	And Ryan says like that's unfortunate, he thinks that's unfortunate, but it wasn't really his fault and so he carries Carl's body past her, being careful not to get any of his footprints into the um blood puddle on the ground.
1131.5	17.0	And meanwhile, Sarah, the lady on the 4th floor, feels like it's been hours since she's seen her lover, and so she decides to take some files up to the 7th floor to do some paperwork with the guy.
1148.5	3.0	His name I think is Carl, but I'm not sure.
1151.5	21.0	Um and as she's leaving, uh, Ryan comes in dragging the body, and she sees her lover covered in, uh, she sees him covered in blood and she faints um, but thankfully she's not on the staircase so she doesn't die, she just faints.
1172.5	12.0	And meanwhile Ryan is thinking, dead bodies, this must be what happens to women, and he has this whole fantasy about how she will um like love him again.
1184.5	14.0	And so at this point Ryan decides to take the body down the uh conveniently placed ladder outside the window that we can just never sneak past the security on the first floor, 
1197.5	9.0	and it flashes down to the first floor, and we see the security guys basically screwing around and watching TV and not really doing anything.
1206.5	14.0	Um and so he uh heaves the body out to the uh, to the ladder, and of course he drops it, and the ladder is teetering, it's no longer propped up against the window, 
1219.5	10.0	and Ryan is balancing on the top of it, and he sees into one of the floors, where he sees a janitor who's mopping the floors.
1228.5	12.0	And he suddenly realizes that a lot of people are probably trying to the get the same things that he's trying to do, like the same type of happiness, which is like a better job, a promotion, and a beautiful wife, 
1239.5	10.0	and he's considering this as he's looking at the janitor, in one of the really weird moments, and he's just balancing on top of the stair, 
1249.5	8.0	and I don't remember exactly what happens next, I think he just goes down the ladder and it ends. 
1258.5	2.0	um, okay.
1260.5	9.0	So then there was another clip called The Black Hole, which also occurred in a um office, but it was live action.
1269.5	11.0	It starts with this kind of like schleppy white guy who's just like looking really bored in front of a copier machine, he's making copies, majorly bored and the office is totally empty.
1281.5	19.0	And the um copier suddenly jams, especially the copy button, he doesn't know what's happening, and so then he like looks around and he takes the um he takes the copier machine and starts looking at it, it starts working again.
1300.5	9.0	And it prints out like this large piece of paper like larger than an 8 and a half by 11, um, which just has this giant, black circle on it.
1308.5	11.0	He looks at it and he looks inside the printer, or I mean the copier, and there's nothing there, except like a splash of ... which flashes of his face.
1318.5	17.0	He's like kind of confused and he just places the large sheet of paper with the black hole, the black circle, next to the printer, and he's drinking some water, and he puts down the cup on the piece of paper, but it disappears and he's like whoa.
1335.5	6.0	And so then he looks a little closer at it, and he bends down and like looks at it carefully, 
1340.5	17.0	and he reaches close so he sticks his hand next to it and he goes like a rraow sound so he pulls it back really fast and then he approaches again, he sticks his hand all the way into it, he pulls out his um plastic cup.
1358.5	13.0	So he picks it up, he's looking at it, and he's looking around, and he decides to go to the vending machine and he takes the black hole or the black circle to the front of the vending machine, 
1370.5	8.0	and he sticks his arm in, um and he pulls it back out with some candy, a chocolate bar.
1378.5	11.0	"So then he's like eating this chocolate bar, looking at this piece of paper and he sees this door that says something like ""Do not enter"" or like ""Authorized personnel only"" and he gets an idea, "
1388.5	2.0	and so he sticks the paper on the door, and he sticks his hand through it and around the door and unlocks it from the inside and then he opens the door.
1399.5	17.0	Inside this office is a safe and so he tapes the piece of paper to the safe and he's looking around cautiously to make sure people aren't there, which he also stupidly doesn't shut the door so people can't see him, so the door is wide open.
1417.5	9.0	Um and he sticks his hand through and he pulls out this giant wad of bills that has like one of those little like rag key things around it.
1426.5	6.0	He's really excited, he reaches back in to grab more, and more and more, pretty soon he has a big pile.
1431.5	9.0	And he's reaching further and further into the safe, to get the last uh stacks of money.
1440.5	12.0	And pretty soon he sticks his head in, and as you probably could have guessed from the beginning, um, basically he reaches all the way in, and he climbs into the safe, 
1451.5	12.0	and then the piece of paper falls down because the tape wasn't good, and then it falls down onto the floor, and then he's trapped inside the safe, and he's banging on it, 
1462.5	9.0	and then the uh screen pans out to the safe, he's banging on it, and then it ends.
1472.5	3.0	Um, okay.
1474.5	10.0	And then another clip was called like the Boyfriends and then it flipped to a screen that said High maintenance.
1484.5	14.0	And it opens on this um pretty fancy dining room and there's a long table with a white tablecloth, and three candles on it.
1498.5	11.0	And at one end, there's this woman, this white woman with short, dark hair, and at the other end is this white guy with dark hair.
1509.5	4.0	And they're eating dinner in silence, and it's kind of awkward.
1513.5	3.0	Um it seems sort of stilted.
1516.5	5.0	And the woman asks him, uh, would you like some wine?
1521.5	11.0	"Um he says no, or no no no sorry, she gets up to pour wine into his glass, but he covers it with his glass and he says ""you know I can't drink when I'm on call,"" "
1532.5	11.0	and the woman kind of like rolls her eyes and she goes back to her seat and pours herself a giant glass of wine and then drinks the entire thing in one gulp and then refills it.
1545.5	9.0	And then the man, he uh, what happens next. Uh..
1554.5	20.0	"the guy says something like ""the asparagus is particularly tender today, honey,"" and uh the woman says, ""some people say that asparagus is an aphrodisiac,"" and the guy's really stilted and he's wearing like a suit and he says ""who says that?"""
1574.5	6.0	And the woman's like, oh you know just some people, you know, like people.
1579.5	15.0	"Um, and then it's really awkward and she suddenly, something happens, which I can't quite remember, and then she suddenly says like ""this isn't what I expected for our anniversary. Today's our anniversary."""
1594.5	6.0	And um, uhh, 
1602.5	6.0	something happens and she throws the glass of water, the glass of wine, into his face.
1608.5	16.0	Um and she starts shouting about how it's her anniversary and this isn't how she imagined her anniversary, silently eating dinner, and some awkward conversation, and then if she's lucky, followed by some really mechanical sex, um which she hates.
1623.5	15.0	"And then the guy sits up, and he's covered in wine, and he takes out a cigarette and starts smoking, and she says like ""not in my house, you don't start smoking,"" "
1637.5	7.0	and she takes it and then stubs it out in an ashtray on the other side of the table, but he just takes out another cigarette.
1645.5	9.0	"Um, and then I'm not sure what happens, but she eventually approaches him, and she's like, ""oh I didn't mean that."""
1653.5	10.0	"It sounded really sarcastic, but then she's sitting on his lap and she's like caressing him and being like ""you know I didn't mean what I said, I was just really angry,"" "
1663.5	11.0	and her hand reaches behind his head, so like his head lowers down his collar, where there's like this little like switch thing.
1673.5	6.0	And she switches it off and then the guy basically powers down, and it turns out he's a robot.
1680.5	2.0	And then she's just sitting there sighing.
1682.5	7.0	She goes back to the other side of the table, takes off her shoes, and sticks her feet on the table.
1689.5	11.0	Um so then she's on her laptop on her bed, and she's looking at the website of the manufacturer who makes these like companion robots, these love robots, 
1700.5	10.0	and I forgot what it was called, it had a clever name, it's like love something or the other and the logo is like this red heart on a white background.
1709.5	14.0	She's looking through different profiles, and she eventually comes across one that's called Paul, which is this like rugged uh like dangerous type guy with like kind of long, shaggy hair.
1723.5	11.0	Um and she's looking at this guy and comparing it to her like shut-off robot which is really like staid and boring.
1734.5	11.0	So she takes up this Bluetooth uh phone, she sticks it in her ear and she calls the company, and they ask like what can I do for you?
1745.5	15.0	"And she says, um, she sounds kind of nervous, and she says like, ""I'm really disappointed with my companion, my companion product,"" and they're like ""oh so what kind do you have?"" and she says she has like the 100 model, "
1760.5	7.0	and then they ask what her complaint is, and she says that he has no ambition, no spontaneity,
