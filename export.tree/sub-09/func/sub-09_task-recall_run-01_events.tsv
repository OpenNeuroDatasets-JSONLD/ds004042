1.7	21.0	The first movie that I remember is um the Aviator movie and the beginning there was a game show with three men who claimed they their name is Jack, I forget the name of the character, but three con men.
23.7	16.0	They, uh, before the age of 19, they were some government official for Georgia, an aviator for a plane, and something to do with a hospital.
42.7	17.0	And then it goes to a guy named Carl who works with the FBI and he goes to the center, which the guy...maybe Jack...is being held and he tries to talk to Jack through a little tiny hole in the wall that is open.
59.7	4.0	I think he has some sort of history with Jack, I'm not sure if he was trying to find out information or what.
63.7	6.0	Jack is being held in a really severe punishment system, 
69.7	18.0	so Jack pretends to faint, or pretends to get really, really sick and Carl's trying to talk to him and Carl screams for an ambulance or for a doctor so that the other guys come and they bring him to the hospital, 
86.7	18.0	but then, yeah, all the men put him on the bed and they start washing their hands and Carl said `what are you doing' and the guy said that the doctor is coming the next day and they see that the door to the hospital room just closed, 
103.7	17.0	so they follow the route and they see that Jack, or whoever the man's name is has left the room, he's not in his bed anymore, and they run after him and they find him crawling on the floor of the prison, 
120.7	19.0	a bunch of angry and enthusiastic prison men are screaming batting their cages while he's crawling around the floor and then the FBI men walk fastly towards him and one of them puts a gun to Jack's head, 
138.7	9.0	and Jack goes on the ground and kind of puts his hands and arms out, kind of like he surrenders.
148.7	15.0	"I remember when he's leaving the hospital room, Carl said ""Oh Jack"" kinda like he knows that it's very much like Jack who's the con man, he's able to get himself out of a lot of situations by acting a certain way."
164.7	10.0	The next movie was the movie about, it was a cartoon movie, I think it was called the Record, and it was a very cute movie.
173.7	14.0	It was a girl, and when she was a young adult, she had red hair, orange hair, and she started eating a pizza and she put a record on and the record of a girl's voice,
186.7	21.0	and when she was moving the place in the record in the song, whatever that part of the record player is called, she noticed that the pizza is disappearing, and depending on where the record was in its cycle, the pizza was appearing and disappearing.
207.7	7.0	And then scene goes to the box of pizza, the entire pizza is disappearing and reappearing.
215.7	19.0	Then she jumps on the record to different points and the next point that she jumps to is to the time in her life where she's already married because there's a picture frame in the wall of her in a wedding veil and she's pregnant.
233.7	12.0	She looks down at stomach and she's playing around with the record to see her stomach grow and shrink and then she skips to when she was a baby herself and she has a doll in her hand and a playpen there, 
245.7	18.0	and then she skips to when she's an older woman, and she keeps getting, there's this weird electric field that keeps happening in the record, and in her chair she keeps getting thrown away, like she can't reach the record to switch her position again.
262.7	10.0	Then she switches, when she does get to switch her position again she switches to this even older woman using a walker.
272.7	5.0	And that's all I remember of that one.
278.7	2.0	These are definitely gonna be out of order.
280.7	2.0	There was the shoe.
282.7	5.0	It was really cute, it was a man and a woman.
287.7	16.0	The man is leaning against some other guy's car, it's not his own car, and in the beginning of the scene it shows a rapper near his feet maybe he just needs something and then he goes up and he's drinking milk, he's looking inside the milk carton.
302.7	8.0	And then he sees a girl, catches his attention, that's when some Italian looking man comes over and yells at him about leaning on his car.
310.7	8.0	So then the guy starts walking away, but he's still looking at this girl, and then the girl's being cute and starts imitating what the guy's doing.
318.7	13.0	So they start, she starts copying moves that he's doing and he goes to put the milk carton on top of the fence and she also raises her hand in the same motion, and then he trips and she trips, 
330.7	10.0	this happened before the milk carton thing, and then she does this little dance and he does this little dance, they go back and forth for a while but then they get to the end of the sidewalk, 
339.7	12.0	and she realizes that it's the end of the sidewalk and a car is coming on his end, and he doesn't realize it and he continues to walk into the street, trying to entertain her.
350.7	11.0	He gets hit by the car, the car flies dramatically, it lands somewhere, and then it goes back to the girl, super surprised and doesn't know how to react, 
361.7	9.0	and then it goes down to the shoe, that came out of I guess from the guy who got hit by the car whose shoe also came flying towards her.
370.7	10.0	Then it shows another shoe, it's a black shoe, and maybe that was saying that the same thing has happened to her before or to other people before. I don't really know the significance, but...
382.7	3.0	Um.. let's see.
395.7	7.0	The one movie where the guy doesn't know where he is; very well-dressed man, probably takes place in the 50s.
403.7	3.0	He ends up somewhere that's surrounded by mountains 
405.7	13.0	and it begins he asks a waitress for the closest phone call is and she gives a little bit of trouble that he finds it and then a million buttons is on it and something like the device he's probably never seen before.
417.7	11.0	He dials for a cab and an Asian woman pulls up and tells him it's the local cab and he says just take me as far away as you can.
427.7	11.0	And then she takes him far away, she spoke French to him at first, he didn't understand why and asked and she said that most people speak French so it's kind of safe to do that.
438.7	10.0	And then later on in the conversation she says something about the place being very metropolitan, I think meaning that a lot of people are attracted there or do live there.
448.7	14.0	So then she takes him as far as she can go and lets him out and it costs 2 credits on the charge but I don't think he had that so she let him go and she did the whole signal, see you around or see you later.
462.7	15.0	Then he looks into the window shop and then he walks into the shop and asks the man for a map, and the man says black and white or color and the guy says it doesn't matter.
476.7	11.0	So the man who works there pulls out, he's wearing an apron, pulls out a black and white map, and the black and white map just has wherever he is, surrounded by mountains.
486.7	4.0	And everything is very, very generally described.
489.7	10.0	So he asks for a bigger map and guy takes out the black, the color one, says it's much more expensive, but that map has the same amount of detail.
498.7	18.0	The man is getting very frustrated because he doesn't know where he is and the man who worked there said they only have local maps so the whole place seems like they're confining people and people can't really leave the area and it ends.
521.7	4.0	Oh there was a cartoon movie 
525.7	5.0	and it was about the guy who wanted to get a promotion.
531.7	2.0	His name was Keith?
533.7	15.0	And then Keith really liked a girl named Sarah, and the entire film is shown in an office building that had at least separate floors to it.
548.7	2.0	And I think Sarah worked in the fourth floor.
550.7	6.0	Anyway the man, he's a green man, he wore a hat and had a suitcase, 
555.7	13.0	and he always went up to Sarah and gave her a cup of coffee every morning even though she didn't want it because that was part of his plan to someday marry her after he gets his promotion 
567.7	7.0	and when he walks up to the fourth floor she was bent over, which is funny.
576.7	14.0	He goes into the elevator and looks at his reflection pretty confidently, and then he goes to be talked to by his boss and realizes that he doesn't get a promotion that he thought he was going to get.
590.7	8.0	Meanwhile another guy a coworker got the promotion and he also goes up to tell Sarah, a very special lady, that he got the promotion.
598.7	15.0	And Sarah jumps into his arms and they're hugging for a while, then they're making out, and he goes up the elevator to go to Sarah and see if she wants another cup of coffee, sees them making out, and gets really upset.
613.7	8.0	Then the guy, when he's done making out with Sarah, goes into the elevator, well he asks Keith if he can hold the elevator for him.
621.7	13.0	Then they're in the elevator together and Keith says he forced himself to take a big breath, and when they got up a few floors, and the thing opened, and the guy was about to leave, 
634.7	8.0	Keith said three words that he's never said before, probably go f yourself, and then the guy came back into the elevator, 
641.7	8.0	they started fighting, and then there's blood on the walls of the elevator, and then Keith accidentally, or not accidentally kills the man.
650.7	7.0	He doesn't know what to do so he decides to take the body home while he decides what to do.
657.7	16.0	And then a woman I think her name was Ruth, on the first floor, needed to go up all the way to the 6th or 7th floor, and was gonna take the elevator, but her new year's resolution said that she should walk up the stairs whenever she can.
672.7	2.0	So she's on her way up the stairs.
674.7	10.0	Meanwhile Keith is trying to drag the body down the stairs and eventually they run into each other and then the woman, maybe Ruth, faints.
684.7	10.0	Keith saw her eyes roll to the back of her head, then he continues dragging the body and eventually he's, 
694.7	12.0	what happens, oh I think Sarah goes up to that same floor to try to see the guy who just got the promotion and she uses some excuse to go up and see him.
706.7	10.0	She gets up there and she sees Keith dragging his body, and then Keith thinks that maybe she likes a silent man so maybe he won't say anything, 
716.7	12.0	he doesn't really know what to say and then Sarah faints, so Keith said that maybe dead bodies have that sort of effect on women.
727.7	8.0	And he takes the body and I think he starts going down a ladder that's outside of the building, 
734.7	18.0	oh I remember that one of the first things that happened is that when Keith brought coffee up to Sarah, the speaker's making a point that Sarah never drinks his coffee, and she dumps it outside the window and it hit a guy and the guy fell.
752.7	4.0	And then different people saw the man fall through the window.
756.7	5.0	Anyway, back to Keith dragging the body down the ladder on the outside of the building.
761.7	10.0	And then after he got down the ladder he's appalled and sees a man who works there and he's been working there for 8 years, and he's never seen this man before.
771.7	11.0	And he's pondering life and how any man probably wants the things the he wants, like a good job, a nice wife, yada yada yada.
781.7	7.0	Then, yeah he had like a very interesting moment there swaying back and forth on the ladder, and it ends.
792.7	14.0	Another scene that stands out to me is the scene where towards the end of all the movies I've watched, the guy, who's probably young 20's, it's the middle of the day, 
805.7	9.0	it doesn't seem like he's really doing anything, there's a bag of strawberry something, a box of strawberries something within a bag he's holding, and he has his headphones on.
814.7	13.0	And there's a woman who pulls up at the car and she gets out to use the payphone while her car, I guess it's in neutral, starts rolling away, and the payphone I guess is not working.
826.7	10.0	She's wearing like this floral open shirt, she runs over to the guy who's on the curb with headphones and she asks to use his phone.
837.7	3.0	So she starts using his phone when she's on the phone, 
839.7	10.0	she's like yelling at whoever she's on the phone with saying that I'm going to turn you into the police, she's really frantic, and she's really upset, has no shoes on, she's in the middle of the street,
848.7	6.0	and then she gets so angry at the phone call that she throws the phone at the ground, breaks the phone.
854.7	7.0	So then, the guy goes over to his phone, and was like, miss miss miss, are you going to pay for this?
861.7	10.0	Like at least 60 dollars and she's completely ignoring him because she's very much in a really dangerous mental place right now I guess.
871.7	11.0	And then some car pulls up and it's under the bridge and for a while the camera shows the back of the head's man in the car and he's got an earring under his left ear.
882.7	7.0	And he's wearing, he kind of unzips his suit and tie, I guess he's coming from work, he has a red car.
889.7	10.0	And anyway, the woman starts walking towards the car and the guy with the headphones is following her, still asking for money for his phone.
899.7	18.0	And they get up to the car and the guy walks out and him and the woman are having, they're bickering, and the man is asking the woman if the woman told the other guy with the headphones who he is.
917.7	14.0	And she's saying I'm not sure if she responded to that, but basically she said that he's a friend of hers, so the guy thought that they're somehow related, I'm not really sure, somehow associated.
930.7	8.0	And then the guy, the woman keeps asking the man in the car where is she where is she and he's not answering her.
937.7	5.0	And then she pulls out a gun, and then I think she's got red curly hair.
942.7	4.0	Then he does a magic trick, and the gun comes out.
946.7	14.0	Oh that happens after the guy was like did you tell him who I am and then the kid was like oh you're the magician from whatever show and then she's your assistant.
960.7	10.0	So yes, later on when she draws the gun, then he creates it from his magic, they're pointing it at each other and threatening.
969.7	4.0	He asks if it's loaded and she doesn't answer.
972.7	3.0	He asks if it's loaded before he pulls out his own gun.
975.7	4.0	And then at some point she shoots at this guy to indicate that it is loaded.
978.7	18.0	And anyway the guy walks over to the kid with headphones, and pulls out this really weird box that's wrapped in cloth and the box is like a tiny coffin with a cross on it, and inside is a skeleton, probably of a little frog.
996.7	10.0	And then the guy starts doing this weird magic trick voodoo thing, starts saying this chant to the kid, and the kid's watching.
1005.7	10.0	And the guy says it wrong, and the kid falls to the ground, the guy says son of a bitch, I guess he said it wrong.
1014.7	8.0	He pulls out the words on it and he's repeating it to himself, trying to see where his mistake was.
1022.7	7.0	Meanwhile the woman is trying to find, she hears the girl that she's been asking for.
1029.7	12.0	She hears the girl moaning or making some noises and then she goes over to the trunk and then she sees, you don't really see the girl in the trunk, but you see the woman's expression and she's really flabbergasted.
1041.7	6.0	And then the woman goes over to the guy and she shoots him.
1046.7	4.0	Then he falls to the ground, and right before he dies, he shoots her back.
1050.7	11.0	Meanwhile the kid with the headphones is on the ground from the spell, he starts barking like a dog, he's acting like a dog, and he's responding to the barks of another dog.
1061.7	12.0	And then the girl appears and she's also acting like a dog and it was the girl that was in the car trunk and so they're barking at each other and sniffing each other and acting like dogs together 
1072.7	14.0	and I guess what happened was that the man probably did a magic trick, he's probably practicing a magic trick on the woman's daughter, or a girl that was special to the woman, 
1086.7	7.0	and the woman got really upset about it, but he made the exact same mistake on the kid with the headphones and it ends there.
1102.7	16.0	Oh there's the robot one where a woman with short hair, dark hair and dark eyes, she's sitting at a long table on the long side across from her boyfriend, it's called the boyfriend.
1120.7	14.0	She, it's pretty quiet between the two of them, and she asks the boyfriend if he wants to drink white wine and he says he doesn't want to drink because he has a big day tomorrow at work, I think he has a client or something the next day.
1134.7	9.0	And the woman's trying to talk to him and she's clearly not driving with him very well, not getting along with him.
1143.7	2.0	I think she's really upset with him.
1145.7	10.0	And when he says that he won't drink, she throws a little bit of a tantrum and says like you're a computer, you should relax.
1156.7	5.0	She throws her drink at him and then after they start fighting.
1161.7	9.0	And that happens after she pours herself two full glasses of wine, and now she chugs the first one, almost rubbing in his face that she's going to drink one for him.
1171.7	4.0	Meanwhile he's looking at his silverware, continuing to eat his food.
1174.7	14.0	Anyways when she throws her wine at his face, he starts lighting his cigarette, so she goes over, she's just furious, she takes the cigarette and goes to the sink and puts the cigarette out, the rule that nobody can smoke in her house.
1188.7	5.0	And as she turns around, he's lighting a second cigarette.
1192.7	16.0	Then she goes over to him, sits on his lap, and with being all cuddly and affectionate and kind of apologetic, and meanwhile, and she's acting like rubbing him all affectionately 
1207.7	12.0	and she goes to the back of his neck and she turns this robotic switch that was on to off, which kills him or shuts down his machinery because he's a robot.
1218.7	12.0	Then she goes online, she has an Apple computer, she looks up at the table and there he is, with his feet and his head fallen down in front of him.
1230.7	15.0	She's on the computer, she's on the robotics.com website and she's just looking for a model that's more upgraded, a model that she'd like better and she calls up the service and the phone number for the service is filled with eights and zeros, 
1244.7	14.0	and she talks to a woman on the phone and the woman says that the models that are in the 100s is like her previous boyfriend, tends to have the problems that the woman was explaining.
1258.7	5.0	The problems that the woman was explaining was that he lacks ambition, and something else I forget.
1263.7	15.0	Anyway the woman on the phone says would you like an upgraded version and the girlfriend says yes and she's looking and she suggests that she gets a rock climber or a masseuse and she goes what about a rock-climbing masseuse?
1278.7	5.0	And then she starts tailoring her ideal boyfriend to the woman on the phone.
1282.7	4.0	She wants shorter hair, more sporty.
1285.7	9.0	So that was the suggestion that the woman on the phone had, if she had any suggestions on what update she wants.
1293.7	2.0	Then she gets a knock on her door,
1294.7	21.0	it's two women, one was blonde with a ponytail, and they're wheeling in the new robot, and the robotics company on the box where the new robot was coming in had some logo or motto on it something like love at first sight or like find true love,
1314.7	2.0	something like that.
1317.7	8.0	And anyway meanwhile, her ex-boyfriend is now being propped up on a cart and taken away, and she goes wait a second.
1324.7	4.0	She goes over to him, gives him a quick kiss on the lips and takes off his wedding ring.
1328.7	11.0	And then she puts the wedding ring on the new robot, and they then she's sitting at dinner with the new robot.
1338.7	4.0	Oh this is her anniversary by the way, and I think that's why she got so upset.
1341.7	6.0	I think she was married to the old robot for a while and it was her anniversary and I guess she's getting increasingly not happy with it.
1349.7	6.0	So then anyways basically she replaced her ex-boyfriend with the new robot, she thinks it's better.
1355.7	9.0	She's, they're at dinner and she turns him on, he takes a few seconds, he blinks, and then they're chit chatting, 
1363.7	18.0	and basically they're having a conversation, you know the same conversation that she had with her ex-boyfriend about the asparagus and she says something about Aphrodite or aphrodisiac, and saying something about that's just what people say.
1382.7	15.0	Those were words from out of her mouth to making to her ex-husband, and that conversation followed the whole conversation that he said that he was not going the have any wine, and then, sorry, I'm not being very straight right now, 
1397.7	9.0	but when the new boyfriend, the girl asks if he wants wine, and he came up with the same response as the ex-boyfriend saying no I have a big day at work tomorrow.
1406.7	2.0	So she gets frustrated for a second 
1407.7	24.0	but then the new boyfriend he said the asparagus is very tender and said something about the aphrodisiac and then the girlfriend smiles because basically he just fulfilled something the ex-boyfriend lacked and I guess he also reminded her of her, making a note that they're a better match.
1431.7	12.0	So then the rock climber masseuse new boyfriend comes over out of his seat to give her a neck massage, and during the neck massage, he asks her how her day was, and then he flips her robotic switch off.
1443.7	15.0	So then the new boyfriend basically shut down his new girlfriend and then yeah he's basically the winner, he goes over to the couch and lights up a cigarette, has a beer in his hand and starts watching sports or something.
1459.7	2.0	So it's a twist in the story.
1462.7	3.0	And, what else is there.
1506.7	3.0	Trying to remember the other ones, I think there were a few more.
1526.7	2.0	Oh the rock one.
1529.7	2.0	So it was a really cute story.
1532.7	12.0	It was about the beginning of time before dinosaurs, and it was an animated movie about a big mountain rock who had eyes and a big round nose.
1543.7	2.0	He's this huge mountain.
1547.7	6.0	He exhales, I think he exhales or something and then time moves forward and then dinosaurs are there.
1552.7	10.0	And his exhaling like, I think it was saying that he moved and the earth kind of shifted, and then evolution was affected by his movement.
1562.7	13.0	And then the dinosaurs are there, and yeah he evolves over time in a few historic events, like Abe Lincoln is chopping down, 
1574.7	15.0	oh okay, before Abe Lincoln, he's a mountain, there are dinosaurs and there's an Ice Age that happens, and he's completely white, and then I think he melts from the ice age and I think he's a little bit smaller of rock.
1589.7	14.0	And then years later there's a tree on top of his head and then Abe Lincoln or Washington or whoever it was, was chopping down the tree, I think it was some historical reference, I'm really bad with history and I'm not thinking about that right now.
1602.7	19.0	But then you see an industrial revolution happen around him and then he is, he goes through all these different stages of his life and each stage he gets smaller and smaller, 
1620.7	22.0	so he goes to a factory and he's used as a wheel, I think with a belt wrapped around it to make something, and these people come in with pitchforks, these officials, and they take him and trying to think about things that he did.
1648.7	13.0	I forget the series of events exactly, but I know at one point he was a rock that was being kicked around by a man who was above in one of the cities that was next to a harbor.
1662.7	12.0	The guy who's kicking, the guy had flowers in one of his hands, and he's kicking the rock, and then he takes the rock and throws it towards, he throws it at the window that I guess that his lover is in, 'cause she was eating with another man.
1674.7	3.0	The rock hits other man.
1676.7	16.0	And then at one point  the rock is in the middle of a street and then a truck is coming, a truck that cleans the street or rolls the street flat, and it rolls him flatter, then he's more of a pebble.
1692.7	16.0	And then I know at one point he's part of the sand and this big crane comes and scoops him up and adds him to a big pile of little pebbles, and then he's dipped, he's made into lava, he's made into fire, he's melted down.
1709.7	13.0	And then he comes up from the other side as glass and he's in a factory, and these men covered in covers and face protectors put a big black box on top of him, 
1721.7	12.0	and then he goes to NASA or some aircraft place and he becomes the glass in front of a spaceship or a satellite.
1732.7	12.0	And he goes off into space and he hits a few objects that are in the atmosphere and then basically gets caught in the orbit of one of the planets that's not Earth, 
1743.7	11.0	and he spins around and around and he gets, he gets thrown onto the surface of the new planet.
1753.7	17.0	And this story comes full cycle because then after a few years, or a few days, or whatever the new time period is on the planet, he becomes part of the planet's earth again.
1769.7	10.0	I guess the planet evolved over some time, and he's a mountain in a valley with a different atmosphere.
1779.7	8.0	So he just by becoming part of the orbit and then hitting the ground he became part of that earth so now the story begins again.
1789.7	3.0	Um the next one.
1859.7	2.0	I can't remember anything else right now.
1863.7	1.0	I'm still thinking.
