8.8	N/A	So I’ve been talking about Post-It Love.
12.8	N/A	The male office worker goes back to his desk, and I forget what she’s left him.
18.8	N/A	I think it’s a flower made out of post-its.
22.8	N/A	No, it’s a happy face, it's a happy face made out of post-its on his desk.
29.8	N/A	So he looks up out of his cubicle to see who might have done this, and she's watching from the other end of the hallway, and she sort of looks a little bit embarrassed and goes back into her cubicle.
41.8	N/A	He smiles, and in the next scene, we see her go into an office, and she raises the curtains up, and on the window is a sun made out of post-it notes that he's obviously left for her.
63.8	N/A	So I forget what the next one, she leaves him something made out of post-its, and they keep getting a little more elaborate and upping the ante on each other.
79.8	N/A	And then he leaves her, I think it was on the other side of a door, she leaves, or no, it was in the break room behind him, or in the bathroom or something like that.
94.8	N/A	She leaves some sort of picture on a door or a window.
99.8	N/A	And then he leaves her a picture made out of post-it notes, I forget what it is, but when she walks out of where she sees that, he’s finishing up a giant like mural made out of post-it notes of the two of their faces together and hearts around it, and she's like shocked by it.
124.8	N/A	He turns around, and he can't tell if she's weirded out or, or appreciative, and then she smiles, and they smile at each other.
138.8	N/A	And then the last movie was called Bus Stop.
146.8	N/A	It starts with a young guy at a bus stop.
149.8	N/A	I think he's wearing a red jacket.
153.8	N/A	He looks very dishe-, very hot and uncomfortable.
157.8	N/A	There's sweat in his hair.
158.8	N/A	He's holding a plastic bag, which has a tub of ice, Blue Bunny ice cream in it, vanilla, and he's wearing white headphones, Sony headphones that he's listening to music on.
175.8	N/A	Bus stop is in a very dilapidated part of town.
179.8	N/A	There's a elevated highway to his right, and he's standing there waiting for the bus in the sun.
187.8	N/A	All of a sudden a black SUV speeds by and then stops very shortly.
197.8	N/A	And a woman gets out of it, looking very upset, and she goes to a payphone right there and uses it, but it’s out of order, so she walks over, straight towards him, standing at the bus stop, and asks to use his cell phone, it’s an emergency, that she won’t, you know, run away with it, but she really needs to use it.
221.8	N/A	He gives it to her.
224.8	N/A	She calls someone, and she's asks if everything’s alright, if someone’s okay.
230.8	N/A	And the guy on the phone is not giving her a good answer, so she gets upset at him.
237.8	N/A	I think he hangs up on her, so she curses and slams the phone down on the street, breaking it, and starts walks away.
247.8	N/A	The guy at the bus stop walks over, sees that the phone is broken, picks it up, and says, “Excuse me. Could you pay for this? Could I get like sixty dollars for this? It’s broken.”
258.8	N/A	And she's pretty much ignoring him.
263.8	N/A	And then a nice car pulls up under an overpass a little ways down the street.
274.8	N/A	She says, “He’s here.”
276.8	N/A	The guy from the bus stop says, “Who’s here?”
279.8	N/A	She walks over to the car, and the guy from the bus stop follows her.
286.8	N/A	A man gets out of the car, dressed very nicely in suspenders and a dress shirt and pants.
299.8	N/A	She asks him if she's okay, referring to somebody else, and he says, “It’s gonna be alright,” and the tension’s very high.
312.8	N/A	The guy out of the car asks who the guy from the bus stop is.
318.8	N/A	She describes him as a friend, which he gives her a look for.
324.8	N/A	And he says that the guy who’s gotten out of the car is upset by this and says, you know, “Have you told him who I am? He can’t know who I am.”
336.8	N/A	She says, “He doesn’t know.”
338.8	N/A	He walks up to the guy and says, “Do you know who I am?”
341.8	N/A	He says, “No.”
343.8	N/A	They start arguing again, and all the sudden the guy from the bus stop realizes that he's a magician.
350.8	N/A	I think his name is Arveeny the Great or something like that, saying that he had seen a show that was playing somewhere close.
366.8	N/A	The woman pulls out a gun and points it at the magician.
370.8	N/A	The magician also pulls out a gun.
373.8	N/A	First he holds out his hand, and there's nothing in it.
375.8	N/A	He does a magic trick, and a gun appears, and he starts telling the backstory of this gun.
381.8	N/A	The woman shoots her gun up into the air.
384.8	N/A	The magician sort of backs off as well as the bus stop guy.
389.8	N/A	The woman goes over to the car.
392.8	N/A	She hears noises coming from it, and while she's searching the car, the magician starts putting a spell on this bus stop guy.
403.8	N/A	He says a lot of, a long sort of incantation that sort of sounds like poetry.
410.8	N/A	You can see the guy start to feel sick and sort of change, lose color in his face.
420.8	N/A	Meanwhile, the woman opens the trunk of the car and is shocked at what she sees.
428.8	N/A	At the end of the incantation, the bus stop guy drops the ice cream on the ground, and it starts leaking out everywhere, and he starts barking like a dog.
444.8	N/A	The magician, or the woman walks back over and shoots the magician, and he also shoots her as he's dying, so they're both lying dead on the street now, and the man who’s been turned into a dog is lying there licking up ice cream and barking.
463.8	N/A	He starts walking away on his hands and knees like a dog, barking towards the car, where he hears other barking.
472.8	N/A	And a girl has jumped out of the trunk of the car on her hands and knees, who’s also presumably been turned into a dog or hypnotized into a dog by this magician.
484.8	N/A	The woman was upset and nervous for her, because the magician doesn’t seem to know how to turn them back from a dog into normal, so the boy and girl who have been turned into dogs sort of bark and sniff at each other like dogs would, and then they walk away together, still barking.
506.8	N/A	That’s all I remember. Okay.
