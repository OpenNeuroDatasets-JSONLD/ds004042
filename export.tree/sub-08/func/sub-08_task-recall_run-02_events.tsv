7.9	5.0	Ok so, when we last left off I was talking about The Prisoner.
12.9	13.0	And we were at the point where the guy was picked up in this taxi, and this lady was talking to him about Poles and some other nationality of people that maybe frequent the town or something,
24.9	12.0	and she's like describing stuff and clearly, he's like not fully paying attention, and the camera keeps panning to her like it’s first person perspective of like the golf cart driving or something.
37.9	6.0	And so you're getting to see the scenery and the town, and some people are walking around and everything.
42.9	7.0	Anyway, so eventually, she's just talking to him, and eventually, he's not really saying much.
50.9	4.0	They get to like as far as she's willing to go.
54.9	4.0	And he gets out, and she's like, “That’ll be two credits.”
57.9	5.0	He's like, “Credits?” like obviously doesn’t know what that is.
61.9	8.0	And she's like, “Yeah whatever, I’ll, don’t worry about, you know, you'll pay next time,” and then she pulls away.
69.9	8.0	And then he like walks up this storefront and reads the, there's like some sort of welcome sign or something, and then he walks in.
77.9	8.0	And very, very subtly as he walks in, or maybe not so subtle, but the shopkeeper is talking to somebody else in another language.
84.9	7.0	I don’t know, might’ve been German or something, or I sort of missed it, but it’s definitely not English.
90.9	5.0	But as soon as the guy walks in, they stop talking in the other language and start talking in English.
96.9	13.0	Okay, and then, the guy walks over to another part of the counter, the main guy, and the shopkeeper walks around, and the other guy, the other customer leaves.
109.9	6.0	And the shopkeeper’s like, “How can I help you?” and the guy’s like, “Can you get me a map?” and the guy’s like, “Do you want color or black and white?”
114.9	3.0	And the guy’s like, “I don’t care. Whatever.”
116.9	8.0	And the guy pulls out a black and white map and gives it to the guy and the guy looks at the map, and it’s like very small map.
123.9	4.0	It’s not that big of a map, and it doesn’t cover a wide area.
126.9	3.0	Basically it shows the village.
131.9	3.0	I think it was called Your Village or something.
135.9	6.0	And then there are these mountains surrounding it, and maybe there's a coastline at one point also.
140.9	8.0	Anyway, the guy looks at it, and he's like, “No, I mean a much bigger map,” and he's like, “Alright, well all I have is in color then,” and the guy’s like, “Whatever, fine. Give me a map.”
148.9	3.0	So he gives him the color map.
151.9	5.0	It’s basically the same area of coverage, but just a much physically larger map.
155.9	6.0	And the guy looks at it, and again the camera pans to like the mountains and the village itself on the map.
161.9	9.0	And then the guy’s like, “No, I meant like a much larger area,” and the guy’s like, “Oh, sorry, all we have are the local maps, like nobody really cares about anything beyond that.”
173.9	10.0	And then I think the guy’s like, “Whatever, that’s, you know, whatever,” and starts walking out, and a new customer walks in, and the shopkeeper’s like, “alright, well see you again.”
183.9	6.0	And then the guy walks out, and that’s the end of that short.
190.9	7.0	Alright, so then there's totally at least one or two other ones.
196.9	7.0	And let me take like a second to try to remember what the last one was, I can’t believe I'm blanking on it now.
207.9	3.0	They were all called “The” something.
221.9	3.0	Oh I know, I totally forgot one called The Rock.
224.9	3.0	So that was an animation one.
226.9	4.0	That was way back when, that was like the first one of the second set.
229.9	5.0	Anyway, okay The Rock.
233.9	14.0	What happens in The Rock, it’s a cartoon where it starts off with this like mountain, gray mountain, rock mountain with a face on it, and the guy’s like, the rock’s seeming pretty tranquil.
246.9	6.0	There's a stream that’s running to it, and you see this weird crustacean thing.
251.9	4.0	So it looks like it’s like very primitive Earth.
256.9	3.0	The rock seems very peaceful and happy.
260.9	18.0	So the rock closes its eyes, and then there's like some swirling that goes on, and then the guy, the rock sort of wakes up, and he’s like now covered in earth, so not that tall anymore, and the guy, so there’s some earth on top of him.
277.9	7.0	And he, like grass and stuff, so he wakes up and he pops out of the ground.
284.9	6.0	And he starts walking around, and he’s much smaller now, he's just like a big boulder.
290.9	6.0	And there's like people in the background, looks like they're like farming or something.
296.9	5.0	At first I thought they might’ve been French, but they turn out to be he’s in the U.S.
302.9	15.0	Anyway, so he's walking around, he walks up against, he walks and he sees this like sort of hill thing, other rock, and he like sort of gets comfy and like leans up against it to like take a nap.
316.9	6.0	But the next thing he knows, somebody’s prying him off of that rock formation.
321.9	11.0	And it’s like all these different people that are like not really farmers but definitely like several centuries old.
333.9	7.0	And so they take it, take this rock, and you see it starts getting processed.
341.9	9.0	And he's turned into like a little rock wheel, that’s part of like, I forget what those things are called.
349.9	12.0	They're giant, wooden wheels that like take water and I think by the spinning of the water, I don’t know, they crush grain or something.
360.9	2.0	I forget what the name is for that stuff.
363.9	11.0	So clearly it’s like, I don’t know, 1700s or something based on that technology, and you see like there are rocks outside with faces as well.
373.9	4.0	Anyway, this thing’s going round and round and round.
376.9	14.0	And then some soldiers walk in, and they kind of look like French outfits, but it like clearly like it gets crushed down, the rock gets crushed down into like a cannonball, and then you see it’s actually like the Revolutionary War.
391.9	8.0	And yeah, so the rock gets fired out of a cannon and hits this other ship, the British ship.
400.9	8.0	I think it’s a British ship, I mean if it’s the Revolutionary War it had to have been, but it had a flag that looked weird.
408.9	11.0	Anyway, the ship sinks, the rock like goes down into the water, and I think the rock’s now a little bit fractured more.
418.9	6.0	Basically throughout the whole time, like through the course of events, the rock keeps getting more and more fractured.
424.9	16.0	Anyway, it’s in the water and it’s walking past another, another rock that has a face, and I forget what happens with the water.
440.9	2.0	Somehow it gets out of the water.
443.9	10.0	And it, it’s smaller again, and it's like it takes, it’s walking in a field, and it takes a nap on like a glove.
452.9	16.0	And then next thing the rock knows, a guy has picked him up and flips him over and like the rock actually has a fossil on the back, and so the guy who picked him up is super happy and puts him in a little like tool cabinet thing.
468.9	9.0	And now the rock is like on display in a museum with other rocks that are also fossils.
476.9	14.0	And then this little kid who’s missing a couple teeth like jumps up and like puts his face and hands right against the display and shakes the display, and the rock falls out from the back of the display.
489.9	15.0	And you know, falls down or something, and then eventually falls out of like a taxidermy bear’s mouth or something, and then into a trash can of the janitor.
504.9	9.0	Anyway, the janitor empties that out of like a window or something, and I think the rock falls onto the street.
512.9	10.0	And then there's a guy with flowers looking really distraught who drops the flowers or throws them onto the street, and then picks up the rock and throws the rock through a window.
522.9	9.0	And in the window there's like a couple having dinner, and so maybe this, that was the love interest of the guy who was very upset in the street.
530.9	16.0	Anyway, I think the rock hits the male guy of the couple, who’s maybe stealing the distraught guy’s lady, in the head, I think, and then it bounces off the guy’s head and out the other window.
545.9	6.0	And then it falls down onto the street or, I don’t know, it falls someplace.
550.9	6.0	Eventually the rock makes its way to a landfill, I think.
555.9	3.0	And now it’s like really fractured.
562.9	4.0	And then there's like this crane, oh no, I know.
565.9	3.0	It doesn’t get to a landfill first.
567.9	15.0	It’s in like I don’t know, near the shore or a port or something, and there's other rock stuff, and a big crane picks it up, and eventually then it gets made into, I don’t know, it gets dropped off into another truck or something.
581.9	9.0	So it’s not really a landfill I guess, and anyway, so with a whole other bunch of stuff, sand and rocks and stuff.
589.9	5.0	And next thing you know, the thing is being processed and made into glass.
594.9	7.0	And it’s glass that’s being put as the head of like some satellite that gets sent off into outer space.
601.9	5.0	So now you see shots of NASA and a space rocket going to outer space, 
605.9	15.0	and now it’s this like satellite that zooms off, and it bounces off some sort of like meteor belt thing, and like the satellite gets damaged, and eventually it crashes on like another planet or the moon or something.
621.9	10.0	And then like, you know, the rock’s like, kind of, now its glass is kind of broken, but then it, it just like totally plummets into this planet thing.
632.9	15.0	And I think then swirls happen again, but basically like the planet changes like over time, and basically the rock becomes a mountain again, and there's like a stream or something, so it’s like the circle of rock life.
647.9	4.0	Alright, that’s the end of the rock thing.
651.9	5.0	There's still that last skit that I'm totally forgetting.
657.9	3.0	Let me see if I can remember it.
685.9	4.0	Oh yeah, I totally remember it, it’s called the Bus Stop.
688.9	6.0	That thing was so weird; how did I even forget this--it was the weirdest one, it was cool.
693.9	12.0	So it starts off, and there's this dude who’s like sweating and it’s like a hot day, he's listening to his tunes on his like Sony like headphones.
704.9	6.0	He's got some double strawberry ice cream in his like plastic bag.
709.9	2.0	And he just, he's waiting for the bus.
712.9	15.0	And across the street, this like Ford Explorer sort of SUV car pulls up, and lady gets out of the door, and the car comes to like a sudden stop, so clearly something’s weird.
727.9	5.0	Lady leaves the door open and goes to like a payphone or something.
731.9	3.0	She seems already like she’s distraught.
735.9	7.0	And she like tries the payphone, and it doesn’t work, and while that’s going on, the car just starts rolling a little bit.
742.9	4.0	And then she like sees the guy, and she walks over to him.
745.9	6.0	And by the time she gets to him, the car stopped, it didn’t roll that far, but a little bit.
750.9	17.0	And the guy is just observing this, and the guy is like also just seems like a weirdo, like weird sort of like face, sort of like a Napoleon Dynamite gaze going on, like, and so she asks him for his phone.
766.9	4.0	And she's like, “I'm not going to steal it,” and he's like, “Okay,” and gives it to her.
770.9	16.0	"And she walks to the other side of the street and calls some guy, and like clearly she's upset at the guy, and she's like, “I'm going to go to the cops, like, you know, where are you? I'm here now. You said you were gonna be here."""
786.9	8.0	Anyway, maybe he hangs up on her or something, because she is pissed, and she slams the phone on the ground.
793.9	13.0	And the guy is just watching this and like he doesn’t have a huge affective response, although he's clearly kind of like, “What the fuck? My phone just got smashed.”
805.9	12.0	So he walks over and like picks up the phone, and he's like, “Hey, so like can I get like sixty dollars for my phone so I can get a new one?” and she's like not really paying attention to him.
817.9	2.0	She's like pretty upset, 
820.9	23.0	and then the, it cuts to like this guy driving up in sort of an old school, but well kept car, like a Caddy or Chevrolet, sort of boxy car with some, some, I forget if it’s classical or some weird gospel thing music going on on the radio.
842.9	6.0	And it like pauses there for a little bit, and you can see her staring at him, and he's like staring at the two of them.
849.9	4.0	And I think it cuts to she's like, “There he is.”
852.9	6.0	And he's like under some sort of overpass thing, and that’s where the car’s parked, and he hasn’t gotten out of the car yet.
857.9	5.0	And she's like that's him.
861.9	7.0	And then I think she starts yelling at him or something and walks towards the car and the guy gets out of the car.
868.9	8.0	And she's like yelling at him, and he's like, “It’s gonna be okay, you know, just like, you gotta trust me,” or something.
876.9	3.0	And then she draws a gun on him.
882.9	11.0	And at that point maybe she's like, “Do you know who this guy is?” or something, and I can't remember if at that point he does the sort of magic act and pulls out the gun at that point,
892.9	12.0	or if like right before then the sort of slackjawed guy in the headphones, who’s now taken off the headphones and they're just resting on his neck, but you can still hear the music faintly.
904.9	9.0	And he's like, “Oh yeah you're like the magician guy from, I don’t know, you do the magic,” anyway, and he's like, “Oh yeah, you're his assistant.”
912.9	10.0	Anyway, at that point or like shortly before, the guy has done the magic with the handkerchief to reveal this very small sort of gun.
922.9	10.0	It’s like the sort of gun that in the Wild West women would have strapped to their garter belts, or at least that’s how it gets depicted in films.
931.9	2.0	I don’t know if that was ever real.
933.9	5.0	Anyway, so he has a little small gun like that, like a one-shot gun or something.
938.9	8.0	And he starts describing, and she's just like, “Where is she?” or something and like yells at him or something.
945.9	9.0	But then she like shoots a shot like up in the air, and then you can hear whimpering or something.
954.9	4.0	And it’s clearly coming from the back trunk of the car.
957.9	13.0	And she like goes over to that, and while that’s happening, the magician starts talking to like the other dude, who now like, you can look at his face, he's just drenched in sweat.
970.9	4.0	It’s like a weird element to the short.
973.9	12.0	Anyway, and while the lady’s trying to get the trunk open, the magician guy is like talking to the, to the, to the other guy, 
984.9	9.0	and he pulls out another handkerchief, and he's like, “Do you see this?” and like pulls it open, and it’s like this mini coffin, and he opens the coffin.
993.9	5.0	There's like a skeleton in a fetal position of like a bird or something.
997.9	11.0	Very tiny, and then the guy starts saying something, like it’s kind of like, gospel like preachery thing, but like kind of like a spell.
1008.9	6.0	And then the like kid guy is like clearly in this weird daze or something.
1014.9	5.0	And then like the guy just like falls over.
1018.9	15.0	And the magician is sort of just like, “Oh,” almost like he’s messed up the spell or something, and then he opens up some paper, like reciting something, almost like he's trying to figure out what he said wrong or something.
1032.9	7.0	So maybe he's trying to put the guy into a spell, but he did the wrong spell, almost like he's not a very good magician.
1040.9	10.0	Anyway, by this time, the lady opens the trunk, and like you don’t see what’s in the trunk, and the lady sort of had this gasp thing like, “Oh my god,” 
1049.9	8.0	and then she walks over to the guy, and the guy’s like, I forget if he says something like, “It’s gonna be okay,” or if she just shoots him outright.
1057.9	5.0	And he falls to the ground, and you see him like take one shot and kills her.
1061.9	3.0	So now they're both dead.
1063.9	13.0	And this guy, this dude and his ice cream that's just everywhere, and that shot of him falling over with the ice cream, and it’s like dripping out of the bag, it was very humorous.
1075.9	3.0	It was weird and humorous.
1078.9	8.0	And so now he's sort of in a fetal position over, but he's not dead.
1085.9	6.0	He sort of leans over and I think at this point you might start hearing barking or something.
1092.9	6.0	And you don’t quite know where it is, but maybe you're starting to think, “Oh that was like a dog” or something that was in the trunk.
1097.9	9.0	Anyway, this guy’s sort of like leans over, the guy who sort of like passed out, and he starts barking.
1106.9	10.0	And he's like acting like a dog and starts licking the ice cream and goes over and sniffs the guy, so you're like all right, so this guy got put under some spell that he thinks he’s a dog.
1116.9	8.0	And then obviously the camera pans over, and sure enough, it’s a woman who is barking like a dog.
1124.9	9.0	So maybe that was the daughter, or you know, some person of meaning to the assistant, who is now shot dead.
1133.9	6.0	So they start barking at each other, and of course they do the gratuitous smell each other’s butts.
1139.9	11.0	And they're barking and barking, and they start walking together, and the guy like leans over and goes on all fours, and they're kind of like aggressively barking, feeling each other out sort of thing.
1149.9	8.0	But eventually they start walk, you know, on all fours walking down the street barking with each other, and then it ends sort of like that.
1157.9	4.0	So that was like a weird film, but it was entertaining.
1161.9	5.0	Okay, I think that’s basically all I remember, so I'm good.
