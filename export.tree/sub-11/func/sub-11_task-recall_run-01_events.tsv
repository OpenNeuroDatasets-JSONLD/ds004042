8.1	5.0	"Okay, so the first movie was called: ""Catch Me If You Can."""
13.1	19.0	And there were three imposters that were coming into the talk show and they were asking them questions concerning um what they did, because they were conman artists, and his name was, all of the three were named like William Frank something.
32.1	7.0	And for the first one they asked him: oh why did he choose to do that even though he was talented?
38.1	7.0	And he told them basically that that was the easiest way for him to make the money that he wanted to.
45.1	7.0	And for the second person - who was Leonardo DiCaprio - they asked him: who caught him?
52.1	11.0	And he said, um, Carl, har- some weird last name like carrot, v, and then it flashed back to the situation he was in the jail.
63.1	13.0	Um and I guess in another land, so it was not in the US, and the FBI agent Carl, he came to um, try to bring him back to the US, to US land, and he tried.
76.1	16.0	He was really sick so the Carl guy told the officers there to take him to the doctor's office but while they were at the doctor's office the officers didn't want to bring him a nurse.
92.1	14.0	While they were talking and washing their hands um the William Frank guy - the conman artist - he tried to escape but he was really sick so they caught him and that's when that one ended.
106.1	5.0	"Um and then I think the next one was called ""A Single Life."""
111.1	10.0	So it's like a cartoon and then the girl was trying to eat a pizza slice but then she hears the doorbell.
120.1	5.0	"And then she gets this record, or maybe it was called ""The Record."""
125.1	7.0	She gets the record and then she plays it but then she realizes that her pizza's gone.
131.1	10.0	And then she realizes that the record actually forwards or rewinds her life, so she plays around with it.
140.1	15.0	And ends up being like an adult, pregnant, and then she goes back and is not pregnant, goes back and is pregnant, and then she forwards and has the kid in her hands - the baby in her hands.
155.1	9.0	And then um she goes backwards accidentally as a little kid and then she goes forward and is like, old.
164.1	9.0	Um but then she's like old and is on a kind of wheelchair and has like a cast on her leg.
172.1	9.0	So she can't really touch the record so that she can go backward.
180.1	4.0	So she keeps going back and forth and gets upset.
184.1	12.0	And then she um, and so, forwarding to being like, old, I guess, in a home, and then basically, then I think she tries to go back but she cannot.
196.1	10.0	And so it just forwards and it just shows her that she died and shows her in the, just her like remains.
206.1	8.0	And then the, I think the next one - the next movie - was the one, something about robots.
214.1	3.0	But I forgot the name of the movie.
216.1	9.0	But basically it's like a husband and wife together and just like their anniversary.
224.1	9.0	But they don't look very happy, and they're just eating and the wife offers him some wine but he doesn't want to.
233.1	5.0	"And she gets upset because she says, ""oh, but you're just a computer analyst."""
238.1	5.0	And uh, she ends up drinking like most of the wine.
243.1	9.0	"And then she gets really upset, but before she gets upset, she's, he kind of says, ""oh, the asparagus is tender."""
251.1	7.0	"And she tells him, ""oh it's - most people say it's an aphrodisiac."""
257.1	6.0	"Well she says it's an aphrodisiac and he asks, ""oh who says that?"""
262.1	3.0	"She says, ""oh, I think most people."""
265.1	5.0	But then she just sits there and then she gets really upset and throws the wine at him.
270.1	2.0	And then he just starts smoking.
272.1	4.0	She gets upset and takes the cigarette and tries to turn it off.
276.1	3.0	But then he takes another cigarette and starts smoking.
279.1	6.0	And so, um, then she said something really mean about him.
285.1	8.0	And then she goes over to him and hugs him but then she goes behind him and turns him, turns him off.
292.1	4.0	So we find out that he's just like a robot.
296.1	17.0	And then, she goes back to her computer while he's like, off, so he's not functioning anymore, and she's looking up another like, to get a new husband, a new robot husband.
313.1	5.0	But while she was doing that we see the picture of like, her being married to the other one.
318.1	8.0	So then she wants like a sportier, like, like more like, spontaneous robot.
325.1	12.0	"So she calls and say her current model has malfunctioned, um he has no ambition, um and so they say, ""oh, usually that model is like that."""
337.1	13.0	And so then, they ask her which one does she want, and she told them, oh like a masseuse, or rock climber, and then she wants both, with short hair.
349.1	13.0	"So then we see the people from the robot company - I think it was like ""premateurs"" or something like that - and they come with a new model, and then they take her old model away."
361.1	16.0	And then she looks like she's a little sad so then she runs to the old model - to her original husband - she runs over to him, kisses him, and then she sits down again with her new model, with her new robot husband.
377.1	10.0	Meanwhile she had already taken the ring off of her old husband - robot husband - and placed it on the new one and then turns him on.
387.1	10.0	"And so they're sitting there, eating, and um she offers him wine and he says, ""no, I have a big rock climb in the morning,"" and then she looks a little sad."
397.1	9.0	But then he says that the asparagus is tender and that people say that it's an aphrodisiac.
405.1	4.0	So she gets happy because that's something she said before.
409.1	4.0	Um and then he goes over and gives her a massage.
413.1	6.0	And then she's very happy, but then he ends up turning her off, so then we find out that she was a robot, too.
419.1	8.0	So then he leaves her there and goes over and sits down on the couch with a cigarette and starts watching like sports.
427.1	3.0	And I think that's when that one ended.
430.1	10.0	Um, and then I think the next one was - one second, I'm thinking.
440.1	6.0	I think this was the one with uh, the stick figures - not sure.
445.1	7.0	But there was one about Keith Reynolds, I think that's what it was called.
452.1	14.0	And um, so basically, it's like stick figures, and he's like driving his car to his job and - you see all the levels of the company at the same time, he like walks in.
466.1	4.0	He's very excited because he thinks he's going to get a promotion.
470.1	8.0	He walks upstairs um, to where his dream girl, his crush is.
478.1	11.0	And he always offers her coffee, but she never wants it, uh and then he goes up, to actually talk to his boss, but there's somebody else there.
489.1	11.0	I forgot his name - I think Patrick - Patrick's already there and they're shaking hands, and he leaves and then so he goes in to talk to his boss.
500.1	12.0	But he says the handshake, well he doesn't say it - there's a narrator the whole time - but the narrator says that the handshake is like, was not as strong as he thought it would be.
511.1	6.0	And then, he didn't get the promotion he wanted to, actually the promotion was given to Patrick.
517.1	10.0	Meanwhile Patrick goes to the floor where Sarah is - the dream girl - the Reynolds', Keith Reynolds' dream girl.
526.1	7.0	And he tells her about the promotion and then they're very happy, hugging and kissing.
532.1	10.0	And so then Keith leaves very sad, and he goes down the elevator to the floor where Sarah is, sees them together.
542.1	7.0	And it says that the door, elevator door, was open longer than usual.
549.1	4.0	And so, then Patrick comes in.
553.1	15.0	And then they go up some floors and then Patrick comes, was gonna come out, but then Keith said some bad words, I guess some three-letter words, he didn't want to say.
568.1	4.0	And then Patrick gets upset, and punches him in the face.
572.1	6.0	So then Keith gets upset and starts hitting him and then ends up killing him.
578.1	5.0	And so he has to now dispose of the body to get home, I guess.
583.1	6.0	And then he takes it out of the elevator and is going to down the stairs with it.
588.1	12.0	Meanwhile there's another lady who works there, who likes to go to the seventh floor bathroom because for some reason she likes the soap dispenser there.
600.1	7.0	But she has some New Year's resolution to take the stairs so she starts going up the stairs.
607.1	12.0	So then as he's going down the stairs, she took, the lady who's going to the seventh floor bathroom, ends up seeing Keith carrying Patrick's dead body.
619.1	9.0	And she like, gets really surprised, like shocked, and she faints, falls off the stairs, and cracks her neck I guess.
628.1	2.0	Weird thing, and dies.
630.1	10.0	And so, he leaves her there, and he decides he's going to go through the window, through the ladder, so that he doesn't have to go through security.
640.1	13.0	So then he throws the body off of the, out the window, um, somebody sees the body that fell out the window, so, um.
653.1	5.0	Well beforehand, before the whole thing started, something had fallen off the window.
657.1	4.0	I think at the beginning and they called an ambulance.
661.1	9.0	But back to the part where I was at, um, so he's on the ladder and starts thinking about his life choices, 
670.1	10.0	and he starts thinking about how everybody wants to get a better job, and everybody wants the dream girl, and so maybe the decisions he made weren't the best decisions.
680.1	5.0	So, I think that's where that one ended.
684.1	7.0	And then, I think this is when we get into the next set.
690.1	3.0	There's one that was called The Pri-,
692.1	4.0	well I think first, it was the one about the shoe.
696.1	7.0	So, there's this guy and first he starts off with just a shoe - he's tapping his shoe.
703.1	6.0	And then, you see his, him drinking milk, checking his milk.
708.1	2.0	He's going to drink his milk.
710.1	8.0	And then, he sees a girl across the street, um, he seems to like her.
718.1	7.0	And so, he leans on the car that he's at, but it ends up not being his car.
724.1	10.0	So then the owner comes and is like, upset, and so he just leaves the car, and starts walking across the street from the girl.
734.1	7.0	And starts like, doing different body movements, and she's copying the same body movements.
740.1	8.0	And like he'll put the - he put up the - milk carton, and she like did the same body movement.
748.1	5.0	Um, bent down, she did the same body movement.
752.1	4.0	So they were like mimicking each other the whole time.
756.1	8.0	But then, he gets to the corner of the street, and like she stops and starts waving to tell him to stop because the car is coming.
764.1	7.0	But he doesn't register it as: there's an actual danger, but as: oh, she's still playing with me.
771.1	4.0	So then the car ends up hitting him, like really hard.
774.1	6.0	And then the car ends up roll- like flying in the air.
780.1	7.0	And in the end, all you see is like, one shoe, and then the other shoe really squashed.
786.1	4.0	And, uh, the girl is like very surprised.
790.1	2.0	And so I think that's when that one ended.
792.1	5.0	Um, and then there was the one about the prisoner.
797.1	4.0	So then the guy, he's really confused about where he is.
800.1	4.0	So he tells the lady at the restaurant.
804.1	2.0	She had like a maid outfit.
805.1	10.0	She told, he asked her, where he is, and where the police is, and she doesn't really give him the answer he's looking for.
814.1	2.0	So he walks away.
816.1	5.0	He goes over to where the telephone is and he tries to make a phone call.
821.1	4.0	But the lady asked him for a unit number.
825.1	10.0	"And, well first he asks which register it is, and she asked for unit number, and he says, ""no, I don't have a unit number."""
834.1	4.0	So she says there's no phone call then.
837.1	12.0	And so then he ends up call- asking for a taxi, and then this Asian girl comes in like uh, golf cart taxi-looking thing.
849.1	3.0	And um, starts speaking to him in French.
851.1	5.0	He's surprised like she's spoken French, so they had a conversation about that.
856.1	11.0	Um, and so she drived, he asked her to drive him to the nearest town, but she tells him this, that it's a local service.
866.1	6.0	So he asked her to drive her the farthest away into town that - into the town that they are.
872.1	8.0	And she, and so then she drives him to like this store, and then she tells him it's 2 units.
879.1	6.0	"But then he's confused so she says, ""it's okay, you can pay me next time."""
884.1	10.0	And she does some weird hand sign with her eye- with her, on her eye, saying that, like um, 'see you later' or something like that.
894.1	5.0	So then he walks into the store, and then he goes over to the counter.
899.1	11.0	"He asks the clerk, um for a map, and then um, he asks, ""a colored or a black and white?"""
909.1	4.0	"And the guy says, ""Oh, doesn't matter, just give me a map."""
913.1	8.0	And so the guy like goes over, is thinking about it, grabs this, like pamphlet-map-thing, and gives it to him.
921.1	2.0	It's the black and white one.
922.1	5.0	He opens it, but it's like a very plain map.
926.1	2.0	It just says the mountains.
928.1	2.0	The mountains.
929.1	2.0	Your village.
930.1	3.0	So it's like, there's like no names.
933.1	7.0	"And so he asks, ""Oh, can I see, like, a bigger map with like, you can see more?"""
940.1	6.0	And so, he gives him the colored map, which is basically the same thing but in color.
946.1	4.0	So he like is, like confused and upset.
951.1	5.0	But then he like, somebody comes in and the clerk starts attending him.
956.1	10.0	And he tells him, he did the same sign as the Asian girl, with the ha- with the circle, on her eye, and see you later kind of thing.
966.1	6.0	So then he goes out, and I think that was that for that one.
972.1	4.0	And then, um, what's the next one?
976.1	3.0	One second.
980.1	5.0	Um, let's see, what was after that one?
1024.1	4.0	I think that's all that I remember.
1028.1	7.0	Let me see if I remember anything else.
1040.1	2.0	Oh yes, okay.
1042.1	3.0	There was the post-it love thing.
1045.1	4.0	So, uh, there's these, oh here, there's two more that I remember.
1048.1	11.0	Okay, there's the post-it love thing where this girl is making a copy and uh like there's like a divider and there's two copy machines.
1058.1	9.0	There's a girl on the right side making copies, and a boy, a man, on the next side making copies.
1066.1	4.0	I guess they're in like a company, at their job.
1070.1	4.0	And then she- they look over at each other, and they smile.
1074.1	12.0	And so, they go back to their desks and, but when he goes back to his desk, he sees like a file folder and he's like confused, because he didn't see that before.
1086.1	5.0	He opens the file folder and he sees like a smiley face, with post-its.
1091.1	8.0	So then he looks around to see who it was, and he looks to his left and the girl looks over at the same time, and gets like shy and looks back.
1098.1	2.0	So he knew it was her.
1100.1	15.0	So then the next, then it shows like the next day, or like another part of the day, she was going to her desk - pulls up the blinds, and then sees that there's like a sun, made out of post-its, so he had done that for her.
1115.1	9.0	So then they start going back and forth with the post-its, um the next one I think was when he was in the restroom, was like fixing his tie.
1124.1	13.0	And a guy comes in to use the bathroom, closes the bathroom stall door, and there's like a cloud with a heart made out of post-its that she made for him.
1137.1	13.0	And then, she goes to a closet, um, and then she goes in turns on the light and there's like a bouquet of flowers made out of post-its.
1150.1	2.0	So then they're very excited.
1152.1	15.0	She's very excited so she grabs a whole bunch of post-its um and as she's coming out she like looks in a surprise, and like he had made this huge mural out of post-its of them two together, smiling.
1166.1	4.0	Their faces together and with hearts.
1170.1	3.0	And he was still working on it.
1173.1	5.0	And she was like very happy and like in her face, she was so surprised.
1178.1	4.0	And I think that's when that one ended.
1181.1	12.0	And then there's the one about the black hole, where um he was making copy, trying to make copies, but the copy machine wasn't really working with him.
1192.1	8.0	So he kicks the copy machine and then this sheet comes out with a huge black ink hole.
1200.1	4.0	And he's confused so he puts it on the side.
1204.1	2.0	And he's trying to make more copies.
1206.1	6.0	Meanwhile, he like places his coffee cup on top of the black hole.
1212.1	13.0	But then the cup goes inside, so, but he didn't notice that yet, until like he turned and he like looked at the hole and every time he would get close to it, it would make like a - a vibration sound.
1225.1	13.0	So he puts his hand in, takes out the coffee cup and then he's like very surprised so he folds up the sheet and he sees that it's just a sheet of paper, puts his hands in, 
1238.1	10.0	and he sees that he can go through, whatever object - solid object - so then he gets an idea and takes the sheet over to the vending machine.
1248.1	6.0	And then sticks his hand in and is able to get a snickers bar out of the vending machine.
1254.1	6.0	And so then he gets a better idea about going to, I guess, grab the money from the company.
1260.1	6.0	So he goes over, meanwhile nobody's there, so it's like after hours.
1266.1	4.0	He started the day off wanting to leave.
1270.1	16.0	So then he goes over to the door, and puts the paper there and sticks his hand through the black hole, opens the door, goes in to the vaults, and then he places, he tapes a paper to the vault.
1286.1	4.0	And starts putting his hand in and taking out all the money out of the vault.
1290.1	7.0	But then he gets really greedy so then he goes to grab more and ends up putting his whole body inside of the vault.
1297.1	5.0	But then, the paper falls down and so he's stuck in the vault.
1301.1	4.0	So he's like knocking on the door of the vault.
1304.1	4.0	And so that's where that one ended.
1308.1	4.0	And let's see.
1393.1	3.0	Okay then it was this really weird one.
1396.1	5.0	There is this kid at the bus stop, with his headphones on.
1400.1	2.0	He looks hot and tired.
1402.1	6.0	He has a bag of ice cream - strawberry ice cream.
1409.1	18.0	And then this lady comes out of nowhere, her like, car, black SUV, and like, comes out of it, leaves the door open, and the car's just rolling away and I guess somebody says anything about it.
1427.1	7.0	So she's like on the, trying to talk on the payphone, and the payphone doesn't work, gets mad.
1434.1	14.0	Um hits the payphone, and then walks over the kid at the bus stop and asks him to give her, to let her borrow his phone so that she can make an emergency call.
1448.1	7.0	And then um he lends her his phone, she walks away, calls this person, gets upset.
1456.1	4.0	Drop- knocks the phone on the floor, and breaks the phone.
1460.1	9.0	"The kid at the bus stop, the guy at the bus stop is upset, and says, ""oh, can you give me 60 dollars to replace the phone? You broke my phone, you broke the phone."""
1469.1	5.0	"Well he says, ""the phone is broken, can you give me 60 dollars for the phone?"""
1474.1	10.0	Meanwhile this guy in this like, old 50s-looking car, drives, drives in and is at a distance.
1484.1	5.0	And um she walks away from the guy at the bus stop.
1489.1	4.0	And the guy is following her because he wants the money.
1493.1	9.0	And then the guy from the mys- the mysterious guy that just popped out of nowhere from the older car walks out.
1501.1	8.0	He's like this really tall guy with old suspenders like, older style kind of clothing.
1509.1	2.0	Walks out and like, 
1512.1	1.0	um
1515.1	6.0	"asks who, basically who the kid around from the bus stop is, and she says ""oh, he's a friend."""
1521.1	8.0	The kid from the bus stop is like, weirded out because basically he just wants the money, he doesn't know the lady.
1528.1	4.0	"And then the lady's just like, ""where is she, where is she?"""
1532.1	4.0	Um and pulls out a gun.
1536.1	18.0	"And then the guy, the older guy, basically says, ""you know who I am?"" to the bus stop - does he know who I am? - and then the bus stop kid says, ""oh, isn't that the mag- the person, this like some magician from somewhere?"""
1555.1	4.0	And so he does like a magic trick and pulls out this like little gun.
1559.1	3.0	So they're aiming it at each other.
1562.1	13.0	And then the lady hears like a noise and goes to the trunk of the car - of the older car - and opens the trunk, and is like very surprised by what happened.
1574.1	12.0	Meanwhile, um, the magician guy is talking to the, to the bus stop kid, and telling him.
1586.1	13.0	"Uh and then the bus stop kid tells him, ""oh, I just need my 60 dollars, and then he like just walks away, is trying to walk away, but then the magician guy says, ""I have something to show you."""
1599.1	12.0	And then he has like this scarf with this weird tomb-looking thing with a cross on it, and starts saying some weird, I guess, spell kind of thing.
1611.1	14.0	And the kid is just like, has a weird face, his eyes are rolling back and uh, he like, I guess, becomes like a dog.
1624.1	14.0	But meanwhile before he like really realized that, the lady comes with the gun and shoots the magician guy while he's trying to like, fix the situation because he looks at his paper.
1637.1	13.0	And he's says, he like realizes that maybe he said it wrong, so he's like reading over everything but before he can even do anything, the lady shoots the guy - the magician guy.
1649.1	5.0	And then when the magician is on the floor, he shoots her back.
1654.1	11.0	So they're both on the floor then the bus stop kid is just barking, and barking, then he hears barks back so he's like um following the barks.
1665.1	11.0	And then, I guess the person that was, the girl that the lady was looking for, that was in the trunk was also turned into kind of like an animal, maybe like, 
1676.1	6.0	um, what do you call it?
1682.1	3.0	Hypnotized, I guess.
1685.1	7.0	They were both like dogs, and they were barking at each other and acting like dogs, and then they just like walk away with each other.
1692.1	4.0	And then that was the end of that one.
1696.1	3.0	And, let me remember another one.
1699.1	2.0	Let me see.
1777.1	3.0	Oh yeah, okay.
1780.1	3.0	There's the one about the rock.
1783.1	24.0	And then, so it starts off this big, mountain-size rock is - the cutest nose - is like staring at, I guess, the water, and there's like life, living creatures in the water, and they're happy but then the rock lives many years so he sees time pass by.
1806.1	12.0	He goes from the dinosaurs, and then it's, I guess, the ice age, and then it's just like modern times and it's like greenery.
1818.1	10.0	But then um, he like gets cuts down and it becomes like a smaller rock, and it has like a good tree on him.

1888.1	1.0	I guess,

1922.1	6.0	and then um, 
1928.1	15.0	I think because he had a, he becomes like a small rock, but he has a fossil behind him so, like an archeologist, I guess, finds him, takes him, and then puts him in a museum.
1943.1	7.0	And in the museum, he cannot get sleep because there are so many people like watching him, so much noise, and getting close.
1950.1	11.0	But somebody gets so close to the, to the glass and he falls down, falls into somebody's garbage can.

2001.1	2.0	And then, 
2007.1	20.0	um, but then I guess the satellite knocks into different, like different rocks - meteor rocks or different rocks - and like falls away and he like, falls into the atmosphere of a new planet and becomes like a big rock again, 
2026.1	11.0	like the planet I guess, gets a similar atmosphere as it was initially, where he was initially with greenery and like he's so happy because now he finally gets his sleep.
