856.5	19.0	And he doesn’t know where he is, so he asks, he asks a couple different, oh he sees a woman and a man near this like cafe, and he asked them where they, where he is, and they don’t really explain.
874.5	16.0	It’s just like the town, and so he kind of looks around, and he's trying to figure out where he is, but he sees a map, and the map is next to this kind of phone directory, 
889.5	18.0	and he presses the button for a taxi, and he asks the taxi to take him to the next town, but the taxi says it’s local only, so she just takes him as far as he can go, which ends up being outside of this grocery kind of general store,
907.5	16.0	and she asks him for two credit units, but he doesn’t have any, so she says he can pay her later, and she says, “Be seeing you,” which ends up being a thing that seems to be a thing that everybody says.

972.5	13.0	and on this map you can see also the ocean and the mountains, but it’s only as big as they get, so the man says, “That’s not what I meant,” to the grocer, who says, “We only have local maps, sorry.”
984.5	15.0	And then the man just kind of leaves, so he says, “Be seeing you,” like the woman did earlier, and he makes a kind of like “okay” symbol with his hand, like an okay combined with a six.
998.5	3.0	Then..
1006.5	4.0	the man goes outside, and I think it ends.

1056.5	7.0	and he puts the paper onto the front of a vending machine, and he reaches through, and he gets the free chocolate bar, 
1062.5	12.0	so then he decides to put it on the front of a safe, and he reaches through, and he gets money, then he gets more and more money, and he gets really excited.
1073.5	10.0	So he tapes the paper to the front of the safe, and he like reaches in to get the last bits of money from the back, but he accidentally goes all the way in, 
1083.5	7.0	and then the paper falls off the front of the safe, so he's stuck inside the safe.
1091.5	18.0	And then the next movie was Post-It Love, and there are two people making, a girl and a guy, and they're making photocopies next to each other, or they're separated by a wall, and then they see each other, and I guess they fall in love.
1108.5	5.0	So the, 
1114.5	15.0	one day the guy opens up this blue folder, and it has a smiley face made of post-its in it, which it turns out was sent by the girl, and then the girl sees something made of post-its, but I can’t remember what it was. I missed it.
1128.5	10.0	and then the guy is in the bathroom, and on the door there's like a thought bubble with a heart in it,
1138.5	18.0	and then the girl goes into the office supply closet to get more post-its, and then there's, when she pulls on the light switch, there's lined up with her hand a really big flower with yellow, a big yellow flower.
1155.5	25.0	Then she gets more post-its, and she’s about to make another post-it thing for the guy, and she sees he made this huge mural of post-its with their faces in a heart, or their faces with little hearts, and they're both in it, 
1181.5	11.0	and also when she comes out of the closet there's a little sign that says, “Please use stationary for work purposes only,” which is I guess they're not allowed to pull those out.
1197.5	9.0	The post-its, the rock, the prisoner, the black hole, 
1206.5	16.0	and then the last movie was the Bus Stop, and there was a guy waiting at a bus stop, and it was really hot, and he was listening to music from his phone, no he was listening to music with white headphones, and he had ice cream in a plastic bag.
1221.5	7.0	And then a woman pulls up in a car, like caddy corner from him, 
1227.5	15.0	and there’s a phone, a phone, a payphone, and she goes to use it, but she leaves her car door open, and her car is like moving down the street, but she doesn’t even notice or do anything.
1241.5	15.0	Well she notices, she looks at it, she doesn’t do anything about it, and then she can't use the payphone for some reason, like she doesn’t have any money or something, so she asks the guy to borrow his phone, and she's like, “I’m not gonna steal it.”
1255.5	12.0	But then as she's using it, she like goes across the street, and then she's asking some guy on the phone, “Where is she?” and then she's like, “I'm gonna call the police,”
1266.5	4.0	and then she gets really mad, and she throws the guy’s phone on the ground and breaks it.
1269.5	8.0	So the guy’s like, “Can I have sixty dollars for my phone?” but she doesn’t really listen to him.
1276.5	10.0	She just ignores him, and then she says, “Oh he's here,” and this guy, British guy, pulls up in a car.
1287.5	8.0	And she goes up to him, and she's like, “Where is she? Where is she?” and the guy’s just like, “Calm down,” or whatever.
1294.5	7.0	And then the..
1300.5	21.0	other guy, who had the ice cream, is, comes up, and he's just kind of like, ‘cause he wants his money, and the, the guy, the guy who pulled up who’s a magician asks the woman, “Who is that guy?” and then she says, “He's my friend.”
1320.5	6.0	But then, and then the guy’s coming up, the magician’s coming up to the guy, 
1325.5	12.0	so the other guy’s kind of scared, but he's like, “Oh we’re not friends. I just lent her my phone, and I just want sixty dollars to replace my phone,” but the magician doesn’t really do anything.
1336.5	10.0	And then the woman, she has a paper bag, and all of a sudden, she pulls a gun out of it.
1345.5	10.0	And then, oh, before that, the guy, the ice cream guy, no before that, 
1354.5	18.0	when the guy, when the guy explains, the ice cream guy explains that he's not her friend, the man asks the woman, the magician asks the woman, “Did, did you tell him who I was?” and she's like, “Nobody cares.”
1371.5	13.0	But then the ice cream guy realizes that that guy, the magician is a magician from some casino, and the woman is his assistant, 
1385.5	11.0	so anyway the woman pulls out the gun later, and then the magician gets a gun through magic, I guess, through slight of hand, 
1398.5	6.0	and they hold up the guns at each other, and the other guy is just standing there and doesn’t know what to do.
1403.5	10.0	And then I can't remember what happens, but 
1415.5	4.0	for some reason the woman goes over to the trunk of the car, 
1420.5	16.0	oh she opens it and seems like kind of horrified about what she saw, which I think is supposed to be the girl who she was looking for, who it turns out the magician turned into a dog, I think by accident.
1436.5	6.0	And then the woman, uh
1442.5	17.0	and then the magician is showing the ice cream guy this little coffin that has like a maybe, looks like a dead frog or a frog skeleton or a mouse or something gross in it and the background was a cross, 
1458.5	11.0	and he tries to recite this spell, I think to make him go to sleep, to make the ice cream guy go to sleep, but instead turns him into a dog.
1469.5	12.0	And while the magician’s looking at this piece of paper with the spell on it to try to figure out what he did wrong, the woman shoots him, and then he shoots her.
1481.5	13.0	And the other girl, the girl who the woman might’ve been looking for, who was turned into a dog, comes up to the guy who’s a dog, also dog,
1494.5	15.0	and the guy who turned into, the ice cream guy, dropped his ice cream, which was all melted, and then he was licking it like a dog on the street, and the girl came up, and they were sniffing the ice cream and both sniffing each other I guess and barking, 
1508.5	10.0	and then they, they walk away, or they walk like dogs down the street.
1566.5	2.0	I'm done.
