8.3	9.0	Okay, umm, so I’m going to start with the last one that I saw, which um is called The Bus Stop.
16.3	10.0	And there was a young dude standing at a bus stop with what looked like a gallon or a half-gallon of double strawberry ice cream 
25.3	13.0	and it seems like a hot summer's day cuz it was melting fast and he was just waiting there in a very deserted corner for this bus.
38.3	18.0	All of a sudden, this black SUV cruises into the frame and um this lady wearing um kind of what looks like night clothes, kind of like a night robe comes out and is looking pretty stressed out and um goes to the payphone.
56.3	15.0	Um she seems to be in a hurry because she left her driver’s door um open and she doesn’t have any quarters or is not able to make the call using the payphone um, 
71.3	17.0	so does some mild abuse to the payphone and then um notices the guy standing at the corner of the bus stop and asks him if she can borrow his phone, assuring him that she won’t take it.
87.3	13.0	He hands it to her and she redials the number while she walks away and starts saying these things about how she’ll go to the police and she says that she’s here, she’s arrived.
101.3	16.0	Um and then it seems like the other person has hung up at some point, um after that threat to go to the police, and then she smashes the phone on the ground, which startles the guy a bit more.
116.3	6.0	Um he’s just trying to do a favor for this lady.
121.3	13.0	And then he follows her because he’s wondering if he can at least get 60 bucks or something for the phone, because it’s clearly broken now.
133.3	10.0	And she pretends not to hear him, or she’s just really, seems really focused on what’s bothering her.
142.3	12.0	And then what comes into view is this man behind a steering wheel who pulls in, he’s in front of them, a few hundred feet away.
154.3	3.0	And he comes out.
157.3	5.0	And then she approaches the man who just stepped out.
161.3	25.0	Clearly this was the meeting point and um he comes out and she asks him where her sister is, and he um anyway, he comes out and then asks her um who this other person is, and this is the guy with the broken phone.
185.3	9.0	He’s like I don’t know her, um, you know he tries to explain how she broke his phone and so on.
194.3	18.0	In any case, uh, he accuses the lady of telling the ice cream guy um who he is, and suddenly the ice cream, I’m going to call him the ice cream guy, um, realizes oh!
211.3	3.0	You’re the stage magician, and you’re his assistant.
214.3	5.0	And they both pull out guns being the magician and the assistant, the lady.
218.3	7.0	Um and now ice cream guy is super freaked out, um.
224.3	30.0	Then the magician starts to, starts some incantation, which is like a this weird uh coffin like small version of a coffin and a handkerchief and um starts saying words and then the guy seems to pass out and then faint and fall.
254.3	10.0	And then um and then the woman opens the trunk and is really aghast by what she sees, although we don’t get to see what she sees just yet.
264.3	7.0	Um and then she comes over with a gun, she shoots him.
271.3	2.0	The magician on the ground shoots her.
273.3	2.0	They’re both dead.
275.3	3.0	The guy wakes up, starts licking the melted ice cream.
278.3	3.0	He is now barking like a dog.
281.3	6.0	He is now barking at some other barking, and the barking continues.
286.3	6.0	Turns out the other barking is probably from the sister that was in the trunk.
292.3	6.0	And now they are, I think they are dogs, and they’re barking, and then they leave.
297.3	3.0	Okay that was one.
299.3	8.0	Another one is um about a rock, which is this mountain.
307.3	10.0	And it starts in prehistoric times, pre pre pre pre I don’t know pre Cambrian, like early early earth times.
316.3	8.0	Um and it’s very sleepy, so it decides to close its eyes and take a nap.
324.3	10.0	You see all this fun critters around it like the ones that are fossilized today as they I guess must have been these funky frogs and trilobites and so on.
334.3	7.0	And as he’s sleeping, um the landscape around him changes.
340.3	20.0	You see um an ice age occur and through erosion and various other kind of um tectonic changes, the rock has now kind of, sort of keeled over and sort of eroded a bit to become like more of a boulder.
360.3	26.0	And then he wakes up and then thus begins a series of very disruptive encounters with animals and mostly humans, like there’s some wood choppers that start hacking away nearby, hacking a tree that’s growing on top of him.
385.3	11.0	He finds, he’s super annoyed by this because it’s so noisy, so he gets up and walks into a forest and then um decides to find a spot to take a rest.
396.3	17.0	And then as soon as he lies down and closes his eyes again, this anthropomorphized rock, um people come and wheel him away, and then grind him down, he sort of becomes like a mill stone, um, and so he’s like that for a while.
412.3	11.0	And then um then there’s like soldiers who storm into that mill house, take him, and then grind him down into a cannon ball.
422.3	2.0	So he’s like in the military for a while.
424.3	17.0	Um and then as a cannon ball he like bursts through some mast of some ship I guess and then falls to the water and is passing along and then um is a bit small now.
441.3	21.0	And then um another encounter is what looks like an archeologist identifies like a fossilized imprint of like a trilobite-ish looking thing on his back, and then so he goes to become an exhibit at the museum of natural history of some kind.
461.3	19.0	And then there’s some obnoxious child that startles him by pressing his face against the glass and so the rock falls back and then somehow ends up flying through some hidden chute system at the museum into a trash can um.
480.3	3.0	And then that’s thrown out.
483.3	13.0	Now um yeah, so, so you know, lots has changed, he’s like a rock now that can get kicked and thrown.
495.3	3.0	He’s like thrown through a window at some point.
497.3	8.0	Um, kicked around in the streets, steam rolls.
506.3	5.0	Eventually he ends up on a beach as a grain of sand essentially.
510.3	5.0	He’s like whoa, maybe now I can chill out and take a nap.
515.3	6.0	And then all of a sudden as he closes his eyes, a big scoop comes and pulls him out again.
521.3	6.0	Um and then he’s like poured into a furnace with other grains of sand.
528.3	12.0	You might think that that’s the end, but it’s not because now he is a shiny lens, or something for a telescope that is being launched into space.
540.3	20.0	Um but I think there was some kind of accident and then one of the solar panels got broken by an asteroid and so he like crash lands on this other planet. Um and then on that planet eventually he becomes a mountain again.
560.3	7.0	And then like a little pond and life appears and it seems to recapitulate the first scene.
567.3	2.0	Hey, Janice?
572.3	2.0	Hey, Janice?
