9.6	12.0	Okay, um so the guy is talking on his cellphone, which is like this L-shaped piece of paper, L-shaped piece of plastic, and the operator is asking, what's your number?
21.6	4.0	And he starts talking and the woman keeps going on like no, what's your number?
25.6	11.0	So eventually he says, I don't have a number and the operator says if you don't have a number, then you can't make a call and so um shuts it off and stops so there's a dial tone.
35.6	10.0	So he puts the phone down and then he wanders off and he finds this like display board, um with a bunch of buttons.
44.6	4.0	And he's looking at it and eventually pushes this button, 
47.6	17.0	and all of a sudden right behind him, there's this woman, an Asian woman, with like really heavy eyeliner, um, driving a car, and she says, uh local taxi service, and then she said something in French and then he gets in.
64.6	8.0	And he's like can you take me to the nearest uh town or something?
72.6	3.0	And she says, local service only.
74.6	3.0	And so he says just take me as far as you can go.
78.6	11.0	And then they're driving along a sort of awkwardly quaint and perfect town, and he says to her, why did you speak to me in French?
89.6	3.0	And she says well I thought you might be French.
91.6	3.0	Well actually I thought you might be Polish or Czech.
94.6	4.0	And he says why would you think I'm Polish or Czech?
98.6	6.0	And he's like driving along, and she says well it's a very cosmopolitan town, you never know what sorts you will find.
104.6	9.0	And so eventually they don't go very far and they stop, and he gets down, she looks at him and she's like, she's like, I did tell you, this is a local service.
113.6	5.0	And he's on the sidewalk and she says that'll be 2 units and he's like, 2 what?
117.6	2.0	Two units.
119.6	6.0	And it's obvious he doesn't have any money so she says well, just pay me next time, and drives off.
125.6	14.0	Um so then he sees a store, a general store, and so he goes into it, and there's this shopkeeper, and a customer, and they're talking very loudly in a foreign language.
138.6	9.0	And then they suddenly switch to English, and the man approaches the shopkeeper, and he's like, can I have a map of the local area?
147.6	5.0	And the shopkeeper asks if he wants a small one, black and white, or color.
151.6	3.0	And the man says I don't care.
153.6	3.0	And so the guy goes and finds a map, and gives it to him.
156.6	5.0	And it's a map of the local area and it doesn't have any details at all.
160.6	7.0	Like there's like a town square, and it flashes all around, the camera flashes all around it, and like it says, mountains.
167.6	3.0	And so it says mountains mountains mountains all the way around.
170.6	3.0	And he's like, uh, can I have a bigger map?
173.6	5.0	And the shopkeeper says it's in color, it costs more, it's more expensive, and he says that's fine.
178.6	17.0	And so he pulls out another map, and the man unfolds it, and he sees, it's the exact same thing, but larger and in color, and the area's just surrounded with like mountain and there's like square and shop um it's like a really simplistic map.
195.6	16.0	And he says to the shopkeeper, no you don't understand, I want a map of a larger area, like a map that covers a larger area, and the man says like oh we don't have that, no one asked after that ever, and the man is like, what?
211.6	6.0	And he's confused, and then the shopkeeper says uh you're new around here, aren't you?
217.6	15.0	And the man is confused, and, let's see, they're in the shop, I don't remember what happens next, I think it ends early after that.
231.6	7.0	Yeah he leaves the shop and he's looking around, and then it just ends.
237.6	1.0	Um, okay.
240.6	3.0	And then there was another video that was called like Post-it love?
244.6	13.0	Um and it starts with this uh man and woman in an office building, and they're doing something, kind of like sneaking looks at each other.
257.6	2.0	And then maybe they're getting water.
260.6	4.0	And then the man goes back to his cubicle, where he asks, 
263.6	3.0	oh! No no no I remember what they're doing!
265.6	15.0	Um, they're in adjacent cubicles, making copies, and they're making copies like perfectly in sync, and then the copy machine then stops working, and so they have to repair it with paper, and they're refilling it in synchrony.
279.6	7.0	And then they stand up and they're both making copies, and then they turn to face each other, and see that they're doing the exact same thing, and they look away.
286.6	7.0	And then it follows the man going back to his cubicle, and on the cubicle, on his desk, he sees this blue folder.
293.6	5.0	And when he opens it up, there's a smiley face made out of yellow Post-it notes.
298.6	15.0	He's looking at this and he smiles, and kind of backs up in his wheely chair, he's looking around to see who made it, and as he's looking around, the woman from earlier leans out from her cubicle, looks at him, then turns back in.
312.6	3.0	He's like aha, and certainly he's happy.
315.6	5.0	So then he sees the smiley face, 
320.6	2.0	uh..
326.6	3.0	he also reciprocates.
328.6	6.0	Uh the, let's see, so, um, she's in the bathroom and she's like washing her hands, 
334.6	18.0	and then someone enters, no wait, he's washing his hands, and this guy enters, one of the, one of the stalls and he shuts it and there's a Post-it drawing on it, of a thought bubble with a heart in it, and it lines up perfectly with his head.
352.6	3.0	And so then, uhh, 
357.6	5.0	so she gets and he gets something for her before this but I don't remember what it was.
362.6	18.0	So then it goes to the girl, and she's entering a um, entering this supply closet and she turns on the light and there's a flower made out of Post-it notes, like a pink flower, and her hand is perfectly positioned as if she's holding it, 
380.6	17.0	"and then she um runs around and she grabs all these Post-it notes and she has like this armload of Post-it notes and when she leaves she shoves the door, and right next to the door on the side it says something like ""only use office supplies for business purposes."""
396.6	3.0	She obviously isn't doing it.
398.6	6.0	So then she's walking down the hall, with her arms wrapped, carrying all of these Post-it notes, 
403.6	18.0	and she suddenly stops, suddenly, because she sees on this big wall, there's this big wall, and the guy has created this massive mural out of Post-it notes and the two of them, a pair of faces standing next to each other.
421.6	7.0	And he's carefully placing these purple Post-it notes to make her hairclip, and he's standing there and turns around, and sees her, 
428.6	2.0	and she looks at him, 
429.6	11.0	and actually I thought this was kind of creepy, you see this girl down the corner and this guy you've never heard before, anyways, this guy you've never talked to before is making a giant mural of your face.
439.6	6.0	But she likes it and she smiles, and uh that's that.
445.6	7.0	And I'm trying to remember the first Post-it that he made for her.
454.6	1.0	Let's see,
455.6	3.0	she makes the smiley face.
460.6	4.0	He does something, and then there's the thought bubble.
464.6	4.0	Yes, she makes the thought bubble for him, and then he makes the flower for her.
467.6	5.0	And then he makes the face and there's something else she does for him but I don't remember what it was.
473.6	4.0	Um, let's see.
477.6	2.0	Are there any other videos?
483.6	8.0	Oh! Yeah, okay, there was this um weird one where it was called the Bus Stop.
491.6	14.0	and there's this guy with big over the ear white headphones, he's listening to music and he's waiting at a bus stop when this SUV comes off the highway, stops suddenly,
504.6	7.0	and the door is still open, and this woman, like this harried woman rushes out, and she's talking on the public telephone.
512.6	18.0	Uhh or something but it doesn't work and then she starts approaching him, he's still looking at her, and he's like this really pasty sweaty white guy, really pale, and as she's stomping towards him, the um her car is slowly rolling backwards.
529.6	3.0	And then she asks him, can I use your phone?
531.6	2.0	I won't steal it, I promise.
533.6	4.0	And so he gives her his phone and she walks away.
538.6	11.0	And she's wearing this really ugly like flowery jacket and matching pants and she walks away and she dials and then she's swearing at this guy and she's like, what are you doing?
550.6	8.0	And um she gets really angry and then she throws the phone on the ground and it breaks, and the guy is like what?
558.6	15.0	And he goes over to the phone, he picks it up, and he's kneeling on the ground looking at his phone, and the woman's just standing there like crying, and he says, lady this phone is broken, could I have like 60 bucks to replace it?
572.6	8.0	And she's really upset and isn't responding, and he's like, could you replace it, I just need some money, like you broke my phone.
580.6	16.0	And then it flashes to this guy in another car and he has an earring on one ear, he's driving this old car and starting to approach, and then the guy with the headphones is like, wait, lady are you okay, miss, he calls her miss, are you okay miss?
595.6	5.0	And they turn around and see this car, and he asks her, who's that miss?
600.6	8.0	And then she starts running towards him, and there's this guy in the car with the earring who comes out and she starts swearing at him, 
608.6	9.0	she says fuck you and then the guy is saying, she'll be just fine, and it's all right, you should calm down, she'll be just fine, you'll see.
616.6	3.0	She's like where is she where is she?
618.6	15.0	And he says, it's okay, and she calls him a cock, which is awesome, and then um, the other guy whose phone was broken is approaching them and the old guy with the earring's like who's this guy?
633.6	3.0	And the woman says oh it's just a friend.
636.6	9.0	And she runs off and then the guy with the earring is like, uh, you're just a friend?
644.6	9.0	And he's really aggressive and then the guy says no no no no no, I was just waiting at the bus stop, she asked to borrow my phone, and then she broke it, 
652.6	6.0	and I just want to get money for it, just like can I just get some money for the phone that she broke to replace it?
658.6	5.0	And then he's like, the guy with the earring, is like, did you tell him who I am?
662.6	3.0	He's asking like did you tell him who I am?
665.6	7.0	And the guy suddenly, the guy with the phone, suddenly realizes and says, hey, you're that magician who works at the casino.
672.6	3.0	He points at the woman and you're his assistant.
676.6	9.0	And um the woman rushes at him, and like they try to keep him separate and the guy the guy with his phone just leaves.
684.6	9.0	And the woman's heading towards the car, and she's like trying to force the trunk of the car open because there's like banging inside it.
692.6	4.0	And then the magician runs off towards the guy with the phone, 
695.6	17.0	he's like wait wait wait I have something to show you, and he unlocks this coffin in his handkerchief and inside the coffin is like this little mummy, and he starts mumbling this weird incantation and he's hypnotizing the guy with the phone, 
711.6	9.0	and meanwhile the woman is forcing open the trunk and she eventually opens it, and she sees what's inside, she steps back and covers her mouth.
720.6	9.0	And um the magician meanwhile is finishing hypnotizing the guy with the phone who eventually collapses on the floor, on the ground, 
728.6	18.0	and his shopping bag falls open, and this like white liquid is falling out, and I thought he was dead, but then it turns it uh pans back to the screen, and he's just lying on the ground, and it turns out the white liquid was ice cream from this little carton, 
746.6	4.0	and the magician he's looking at it and he's like oh crap!
750.6	6.0	And he takes out this little notebook and he's like mumbling things, I think he's trying to figure out the incantation.
757.6	3.0	And then, oh I forgot about this part!
759.6	16.0	Um so earlier, um when the guy on the phone is like aha you're the guy who's the magician, and you're his assistant, the woman who's the assistant pulls out her uh, pulls out a gun, and points it at the magician.
774.6	3.0	The magician's like oh is that loaded?
776.6	4.0	Well guess what, he does a little magic trick, and he pulls out his gun.
779.6	13.0	And he says, I also have this gun, and this gun's from, it's a famous gun, and he's doing his little magician pattern, the woman gets angry and she takes the gun and fires it into the air.
792.6	4.0	And that's the point when the guy on the phone leaves the scene.
796.6	9.0	But anyway, so he's on the ground, and there's spilled ice cream next to him, and the woman stalks back over and she's really angry because of what she found in the trunk.
805.6	11.0	And then she shoots him and then the guy shoots her, so then they're both on the ground, dead, with this guy lying on the ground twitching next to the ice cream.
815.6	12.0	And then he like gets on all fours, and he starts licking the ice cream on the floor and the white headphones are hanging around his neck with a cord trailing kind of like a leash.
827.6	12.0	And then he starts barking and there's something, a dog, offscreen barking, and so this guy's crawling, he's barking, and kind of aggressively at this other dog approaches.
839.6	13.0	And it turns out this other dog is this woman who's also apparently been hypnotized, and was probably in the trunk and so they're barking at each other and they're circling each other, um like sniffing each other's butts,
852.6	12.0	and then they start walking off together, so the guy rolls on his stomach, and the other, the lady dog, lady, who's hypnotized to be a dog, is like sniffing at him and then they walk off.
864.6	3.0	Uh and that's the end of that scene.
875.6	7.0	Oh yeah okay! And then the last clip I think, not the last clip I saw, but the last clip I could remember, was called like The Mountain.
882.6	9.0	And it's a cartoon and it starts with like this mountain with a big nose and eyes and it's just like sleeping on the earth 
890.6	8.0	um and there's like all this weather happening and then there's this Ice Age and it sweeps him off the edge and now he's a big boulder.
898.6	2.0	And he rolls along the ground.
902.6	5.0	Um and he's just lying in the ground and like vegetation grows 
907.6	6.0	and then um let's see.
912.6	5.0	He's asleep but then he wakes up because he's annoyed, oh no no no!
916.6	7.0	He opens his eyes and he sees these like humans walking around and then he goes back to sleep.
923.6	11.0	And then when he wakes up again, it's because these humans are making all this noise chopping wood and making these huts, primitive huts, and buildings and stuff.
933.6	9.0	And he's really annoyed, because this guy is chopping this uh tree that's growing on his head, and so he gets up and he walks off.
942.6	13.0	He finds this nice little hill to lie down on, he tries to sleep, but then the humans come with ropes and they grab him and drag him away and uh he's upset about this obviously.
955.6	8.0	Um and they start chipping away at him and they make him into a um grain mill.
962.6	11.0	And so he's spinning on this grain mill um grinding uh wheat into flour and ... that's powering him.
972.6	6.0	And there's all these other stones that are like have eyes and are sentient and being used for various tools.
979.6	19.0	And all of a sudden, there's these guys, these soldiers, in blue uniforms, and I think they're American revolutionaries and they see the big stone wheel, and they take it, and they break him up and make him into a cannon ball.
997.6	12.0	So now he's this little round ball with a nose and eyes um and they load him into a cannon and shoot him at this enemy British ship and he breaks a mast, by a
1008.6	8.0	and the um, the, uhh, 
1015.6	2.0	the ship sinks, 
1016.6	13.0	and he gets broken into like little smaller pieces, and he floats to the bottom of the ocean, and then he uh, oh I can't remember exactly, he like washes up on shore, 
1029.6	20.0	uhh, he washes up on the shore and somehow he gets taken into this like kind of industrial era um industrial era um town.
1048.6	7.0	And he gets made into something else, and I don't remember what, he gets made into something else.
1056.6	5.0	Um, what was it? Hold on. 
1063.6	1.0	Um.
1067.6	3.0	Oh! He gets it made into ..
1072.6	1.0	I don't remember. 
1072.6	13.0	But anyways he gets like thrown into a street, he's made into something else and then he gets thrown into the street, and then there's this upset guy who's kicking him.
1084.6	16.0	He kicks him along the street and eventually picks him up and throws him through a window, where his lady is at the table with this sort of foppish guy and the stone hits him in the head and bounces out another window and bounces out uh 
1099.6	22.0	bounces down off the city into like this beach and then he's lying on the sands and um this big uh like big truck like one of those big scooper things, picks him up and a bunch of sand and dumps him in a truck.
1121.6	15.0	And then the truck is taking him to a uh factory and they're being dumped on this conveyor belt which is taking him out to a giant vat of molten stuff.
1136.6	11.0	And the rock is really scared, and like this is the end, and he pours into the molten pot and he's reborn as this piece of glass.
1147.6	16.0	And then the piece of glass, there's these guys in like uh in uh dust coats, or not dust coats you know those bee suits, and it covers him, and then gets placed onto this satellite, which gets sent into space, 
1162.6	19.0	and now he's really excited and then the satellite shoots its engines and the satellite runs into the asteroid belt where it crashes, which breaks the lens a little bit, and then he crashes back and forth until they finally uh crash land onto a planet.
1182.6	21.0	And then he's just alone on this planet, and um he's just alone on this planet and eventually somehow, he forms this big boulder again and the planet around him becomes terra form so there's these plants growing, 
1202.6	12.0	he's getting into this big mountain again, he's a big mountain again, and he like wakes up and he looks around and he sees the big planet and it's all peaceful and he like sighs and then he relaxes and he falls back asleep.
1215.6	5.0	Um trying really remember what else he gets turned into, I can't remember.
1219.6	5.0	He gets made into the cannon ball, he's at the bottom of the ocean,
1227.6	2.0	I don't remember
1229.6	2.0	Okay, um.
1236.6	3.0	I think that's all the videos, so I'm done.
