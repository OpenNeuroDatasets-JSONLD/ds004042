10.3	N/A	So before the first seven movies started, there was like an old-fashioned music jingle that you’d see while in the theaters with four characters singing, “Let’s all go to the lobby to get ourselves a treat,” and the characters were I think two boxes of cigarettes and a bag of popcorn and a soda, and it showed them walking around and singing that, and it showed people buying stuff at the lobby.
51.3	N/A	Then it finished the song again, and there was a countdown, “3, 2, 1,” to a film starting.
61.3	N/A	First film was from Catch Me If You Can.
66.3	N/A	It started with the protagonist of the film, the guy the film’s about on To Tell the Truth, presumably afterwards, or after the events in the film take place.
86.3	N/A	Three men walk forward, all dressed the same way, in I think an air force uniform, and they all claim to be, I forget his name, I think it’s Frank William Abingard, something like that.
104.3	N/A	The middle of them, number two, is the real one, played by Matt, Leonardo DiCaprio.
114.3	N/A	The host reads out a card of what he’s done in his life, which has to do with impersonating an air marshal, pretending to be the attorney general of Louisiana, and a few other things, and he had made all this money before he was nineteen and found out.
137.3	N/A	Then the three players walk over to their chairs, and the first panelist asked number one a question.
150.3	N/A	The panelist is Kitty Carlisle.
151.3	N/A	She asks him, “Why didn’t you have a real job?” or why didn’t he choose a real job instead.
158.3	N/A	Number one, the impostor, says, “It was more important, it was a matter of dollars and cents.”
165.3	N/A	It was more important for him to just have money in the beginning.
168.3	N/A	And then she asked the real guy, number two, I forget what question she asked him.
177.3	N/A	It was “What was your first thought when you got out of prison?” or something like that.
181.3	N/A	And the real guy flashes back to when he was in prison, or it was the name of someone, the name of I think the detective or lawyer that came to help him, to get him out of prison, that makes him flash back.
202.3	N/A	Last name I think was Hamready or something like that.
207.3	N/A	It flashes back to that lawyer trying to get into the prison.
214.3	N/A	I think it was in France.
216.3	N/A	The lawyer is played by Tom Hanks, wearing a sort of like a slouch hat.
223.3	N/A	He has an umbrella, it’s raining outside, and he's fighting with officers, verbally, to try to get into the prison.
231.3	N/A	And then he's let inside, and the officer tells him to sit on a stool on the other side of a jail cell, where Frank is being held.
248.3	N/A	He looks through the grate, and Frank is destitute.
253.3	N/A	He's on the ground, hunched over in a blanket.
255.3	N/A	He's dirty and coughing.
260.3	N/A	The lawyer starts reading him the case, says that he has a cold too.
268.3	N/A	Frank falls over and faints, or at least is pretending to.
276.3	N/A	Lawyer calls for a doctor.
279.3	N/A	They rush him into the medical ward of this prison.
285.3	N/A	The lawyer says, He needs a doctor,” and the French officer says, “The doctor won’t be here until tomorrow.
294.3	N/A	He’ll be fine until then.”
296.3	N/A	The lawyer says if he loses this case because of him, that the officer, he’ll hold the officer accountable.
307.3	N/A	Suddenly they hear the door open, and the prisoner had escaped the room.
317.3	N/A	They go out to the hallway, and the prisoner is crawling on his hands and knees, trying to get away from him, but he’s sick and coughing and can’t really do it.
329.3	N/A	They catch up to him, and the officer puts a gun to his head, which makes him stop.
334.3	N/A	The prisoner says to the lawyer, “Alright, I'm ready to go home.”
343.3	N/A	The next movie was The Record, it was called.
354.3	N/A	It was animated, showed a girl sitting on a bed in her apartment, about to eat a slice of pizza, when the doorbell rings.
364.3	N/A	She goes out to see what’s outside, and there's a package.

381.3	N/A	She goes to take a bite of her pizza, but the record skips, and all of a sudden, the pizza has a big bite taken out of it.
391.3	N/A	So when the record skipped, it went ahead in time.
396.3	N/A	So she looks back at the pizza and the record and realizes what happened, and starts playing with the record to see, moving it ahead so she goes into the future, moving it back so she goes into the past.
412.3	N/A	She watches the candle burn down and go up, the clock travel forward and travel backwards next to her.
424.3	N/A	She moves the needle on the record much forward, and she's standing in her apartment, and she has, she's pregnant now.
434.3	N/A	She moves it forward and back, the record, and she, her belly gets bigger and smaller.
438.3	N/A	She moves it much forward, and she's holding a baby.
444.3	N/A	The baby starts to cry, so she moves the record forward again, or no, she moves the record backward I think.
459.3	N/A	She goes back in time to when she was a kid.
466.3	N/A	She goes to move the record forward again, but she can't reach it.
470.3	N/A	I think she might fall over or something, and the record skips much farther forward to where she's an older lady.
481.3	N/A	She has gray hair now and is wearing glasses, and she walks using a cane.

496.3	N/A	She goes to move the record again, but it skips back again.
502.3	N/A	So she keeps trying to time it to where she can move it, but she doesn’t get there in time.
508.3	N/A	Finally the record skips forward a little more, and she finds herself in a walker far away from the record.
517.3	N/A	She seems a little content, but all of a sudden she realizes the record’s about to run out.
522.3	N/A	She walks toward it, but the song ends.
526.3	N/A	The needle comes off it, and all the sudden she turns into an urn of her own ashes.
534.3	N/A	Her life is ended when the song ended.
543.3	N/A	The next, the next movie was called The Boyfriend, I think.

609.3	N/A	He says, “Who says that?” and she says she's not sure.
619.3	N/A	So she gets mad at him when he seems disinterested in her and doesn’t want to have sex.
631.3	N/A	She screams at him, and then she walks over and apologizes and holds him.
638.3	N/A	All of a sudden she turns off a switch on the back of his neck, and it turns out that he was a robot.
