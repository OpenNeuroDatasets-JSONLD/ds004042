onset	duration	recall_transcript
10.9	9.0	Okay, I'm going to start with the first half. The first clip was from Catch Me If You Can.
19.9	15.0	We start off in what looks like the stage area for a TV show, and there's a host, and he's talking, and he invites to stage three guys.
33.9	18.0	All of them are pretty young, in their late twenties, and they're wearing pilot clothes, and all of them for whatever reason are addressed to as Frank Abagnale.
51.9	8.0	I think it's some kind of TV show where you're supposed to prove that one of them is Frank, or something like that.
60.9	6.0	The guy in the middle is Leonardo DiCaprio.
67.9	11.0	Okay, so the three guys walk to the three, whatever he calls those things in Jeopardy, and they're being asked questions, 
77.9	14.0	and the first question is for the guy on the left, and this lady asks him why he did what he did, and he gives this dry, boring answer, saying he just needed the money, 
92.9	20.0	and then I think the TV show host, like the guy who's talking at the beginning, white hair, pretty old, asks Leonardo DiCaprio, who's sitting in the middle, who caught him, and he starts to remember, 
111.9	14.0	and the scene cuts back to a flashback in Marseilles, in France, where we see a guy, his name is Carl Hanratty.
124.9	2.0	He's like a policeman.
125.9	13.0	He's got this hat, and he's talking to a bunch of people, trying to get somewhere, and it's raining, it's pretty bleak out, really like dark grey weather.
138.9	3.0	He's Tom Hanks.
141.9	26.0	He walks to this, what looks like this like French maximum security prison and is like let in and finally gets to the cell of Frank Abagnale, and I think he's there to, it says he's there to like prep him for a trial, pick him up for a trial.
166.9	8.0	In any case, it becomes clear a little bit later that, from him talking to the French guys, that he's there to take him to America.
174.9	5.0	But Leonardo DiCaprio's not in very good shape.
178.9	19.0	He's coughing a lot, he's got really long hair, he's like pretty dirty, he seems to be struggling, and finally he actually, during the conversation, he faints and kind of this persuades Carl to call up the French officers and ask for a doctor.
197.9	11.0	He thinks it's an emergency, even though he was advised before not to like pass any food, kind of not to believe anything that Frank does.
208.9	3.0	They take Frank to this infirmary.
210.9	14.0	It's like Carl and Frank and maybe like five other French officers with funny hats and mustaches, and Frank gets sat on this infirmary bed.
223.9	11.0	He's the only guy there, he's coughing pretty violently, and then Carl is pretty, pretty adamant.
233.9	2.0	He really wants a doctor for this guy.
234.9	3.0	He doesn't want him to die before he gets him to America.
236.9	17.0	He seems like he's after some kind of prize, and as they talk, and they kind of argue and bicker, they sort of lose sight of Frank, and at some point they hear this door open and realize that Frank has escaped.
253.9	23.0	Then the scene cuts to Frank still coughing and walking really haphazardly through, through the prison as the other prisoners are like cheering him on, and finally he, the French officers and Carl catch up with him.
276.9	20.0	"Carl kind of gives him this look like ""Uch, Frank you did it again. You just never stop,"" and then Frank turns around and like lays on his, lays on his back, looks sort of resigned and is like, ""Okay, let's go,"" "
297.9	3.0	and the scene, the scene cuts, and that's it.
299.9	2.0	That's the first clip.
302.9	3.0	The second clip was an animation.
304.9	4.0	It opens up in this indoor scene.
307.9	11.0	We see this sort of woman, early thirties, red hair, kind of sitting around with a pizza, preparing to eat dinner.
318.9	15.0	When she hears the doorbell and receives a record, and she takes the record, puts it on her record player, starts playing for a little bit.
332.9	15.0	This like cute, peaceful song starts playing, and I think like accidentally she like pushes around the needle of the record player and realizes that when she does that, her pizza turns, 
350.9	11.0	and she does that a few more times and realizes that basically what's going on is that the needle is, as the needle moves onto the record, it's controlling time.
362.9	11.0	She moves it a little bit, she moves it up and down and notices her pizza going up and down and then the candle, the red candle that's going up and down at the same time as the pizza.
373.9	13.0	She moves it a little further and finds herself in a completely different home, much different, much tidier, kind of white, like fancy, like a fancy mirror, there's some fancy characters around.
386.9	20.0	She's maybe a little bit older, wearing some fancier clothes, and she realizes that she's pregnant and kind of feels around her belly and again like just moves the, moves the needle on the, the record player is still there, still playing the music.
406.9	16.0	She moves the needle a little bit and notices her belly expanding and contracting, and then, I'm trying to remember when it was by accident, but she, so she hits the needle one more time, 
422.9	5.0	and this time she's a little bit older, and she's actually maybe like 50 or 60.
426.9	3.0	She's got gray hair.
428.9	4.0	The scene changes again, and I don't remember where exactly she is.
431.9	3.0	She's also in a different home.
433.9	11.0	The baby's kind of gone, and she's trying to, she starts to not like this, she's trying to reach out to the needle to push it back to where it was.
444.9	8.0	She's in a cast, so her leg accidentally hits the record player, and the needle advances even further.
452.9	3.0	Now she's even older.
454.9	11.0	She's got a walking aid, one of those walking aids, I don't know what you call them in English, and she tries to, she tries to hurry to move towards the record player, 
464.9	8.0	because she realizes that the record is about to reach the end, and she doesn't get there on time, and then the record ends,
471.9	18.0	and the scene cuts again, and we see her, she's disappearing inside an urn, a purple urn with a white cross on it, so she's gone, she's dead, and I think that's where the clip ends, and the music is still playing.
490.9	33.0	Okay, now the third clip, I think, this is the one with this dysfunctional couple, so got this couple, this woman with a close camera angle talking to this guy at dinner and realizes this guy is her husband, and she is, we hear about how it's their wedding anniversary.
523.9	10.0	I guess like, they're both pretty young, they're maybe like early thirties, clearly, clearly pretty frustrated even though it's like romantic.
532.9	5.0	She has candles on and stuff.
537.9	14.0	"She clearly gets more frustrated with him as the evening progresses until she basically snaps and is like, ""Uch, you can't be so mechanical. You're not a surgeon. You're just a computer analyst."""
554.9	6.0	I don't know, she seems like she's trying to get him to do something, to say something, to make her feel something.
562.9	18.0	The scene is pretty dark, pretty gloomy like pretty blue colors, also this blue Keurig, and then what happens, oh right, he doesn't get the hint, he continues to say very lame things.
579.9	2.0	He says that the asparagus is very tender.
580.9	10.0	She still is super frustrated, so she goes towards him at some point, oh, before that though, he starts smoking.
590.9	12.0	"He lights up a cigarette, she gets really angry at this and like, gets up from the table, walks towards him and takes his cigarette and is like, ""You can't, you can't be smoking. It's not what I'm expecting from my wedding anniversary."""
603.9	13.0	He doesn't care, he lights a second cigarette, and then finally she walks towards him and starts caressing his neck and the back of his head, 
615.9	15.0	and we, the camera cuts back to the back, and we see her fingers as she finds a button that was at the back of her husband's neck, and she turns him off basically, and he stops talking.
629.9	14.0	So we realize at this point that he's a robot, he's some sort of android, and she goes to the back, she goes to the room, and starts browsing on her Apple.
642.9	9.0	She's in her bedroom, sitting on her bed, and we see her Apple computer, and we realize that she's browsing for this android company.
650.9	6.0	She's browsing for new models of husbands that she can order.
655.9	18.0	"She sort of swipes through a few and seems to decide on one and then calls the company, the 1-800 number, and she's greeted by this female voice saying like, ""Oh, what seems to be the problem with your, with your model?"""
673.9	9.0	"Trying to remember what she says, I think she says something like, oh, hes's something like, ""Not passionate enough. He's too boring"" basically, "
681.9	9.0	"and the lady on the phone says, ""Well that's kind of a common, common thing. Do you, would you like, with this model, would you like another model?"""
689.9	15.0	"She says, ""Yes. Could I have someone sportier?"" and it's funny, she picks this guy who's like a masseuse and a yoga instructor at the same time, a little scruffier, a little more athletic, less put together than her previous one,"
704.9	4.0	and then at some point you hear the doorbell ring.
707.9	20.0	Some time must have passed, and you see this, there's a lady from the company, and there's another lady, and they unpack from a plastic-y weird thing, they unpack the second model and replace, take away the old guy.
728.9	19.0	"So the new guy comes to the table, sits in the same spot, and I think it's the wife that turns him on, using the same button in the back and picks up the conversation, saying, ""Oh the asparagus is really tender,"" "
748.9	4.0	and oh right, a key point that I forgot to say from before.
752.9	11.0	She tries to, she tries to lure him into, into possibly having sex by alluding to the fact that the asparagus is a good aphrodisiac, and the guy before doesn't get the hint.
762.9	13.0	"This guy, however, the new guy, says the same thing about the asparagus, ""Oh it's really tender,"" and he actually says himself that some people say it's an aphrodisiac, and she's obviously really excited about this."
775.9	12.0	At this point he gets up from the table and walks towards her and starts giving her a massage and asking her how her day went and this goes on for about a minute, 
787.9	9.0	until finally we see, surprise, surprise, his fingers slipping to the back of her neck and he turns her off.
795.9	3.0	It turns out she was an android as well.
799.9	13.0	He turns her off, and he gets up and sits on the couch, puts his feet up, turns the TV on, and starts watching TV, and that's the end of this pretty weird clip.
814.9	5.0	Okay, fourth clip is about, it's kind of weird.
818.9	15.0	It's called The Shoe, so the camera, the scene opens up with this close-up of a shoe, and we realize that the shoe belongs to this guy, who's standing in the street, near the sidewalk, 
834.9	9.0	and he's trying to open a milk carton to drink out of it, so we sort of like look at, we see his milk carton as he's opening it.
843.9	1.0	He manages to open it.
843.9	10.0	He looks inside, he looks inside to see whether the milk is good or something, and then he drinks it, and he seems very happy.
853.9	17.0	The camera pans out, and we see we're in some kind of suburban sunny area, and there are cars on the road, and at some point this guy catches the eye of this other girl on the other side of the street, 
870.9	13.0	and they kind of start getting into this sort of playful imitation game, where he does something funny with his hands, and she does something funny, and then they start sort of dancing in tandem and laughing.
882.9	17.0	It's all really cute and stuff, until he gets too wrapped up in the game, and to her, to her great dismay, he gets run over by a car while he's, he's not looking, so he gets run over by this car.
898.9	19.0	I think it was some sort of old 70s like reddish car, and the car doesn't manage to avoid him, and not only does it hit him, but it also skids out and hits this other car and jumps up in the air, 
918.9	16.0	and this guy, I think, is thrown in some weird way, like he hits the windshield, the windshield shatters, and all we see is this shoe jumping into the air, 
933.9	21.0	and then they have this, this sort of camera panning, showing us the trajectory of the shoe as it jumps through the air and falls onto the sidewalk, and then we get this camera move towards this other shoe, this black leathery shoe, and that's where this one ends.
954.9	3.0	Um, okay, I think that was four.
956.9	11.0	So the fifth one was the second animation in the series, and it's funny, this was like a 2D video about this guy named Keith Reynolds.
966.9	19.0	He's like this blue, slender, sinewy stick figure, and he has a hat, and he has a briefcase, and we see him as his car drives, he drives left to right because it's 2D, 
986.9	11.0	and he gets off at his office, and we learn from the narration that he is about to get promoted, or so he thinks.
996.9	9.0	He's getting amped up for this, gets prepared, and before, so he walks into the building of his work.
1005.9	17.0	This is an office building, and before going upstairs to his manager, oh, before that, there's a funny line about what his status in the company is, and apparently he's the most senior junior associate at this company.
1023.9	18.0	Right, so he first goes to his floor, and turns out he's officemates with this woman, I think her name is Sara, that he's been trying to woo, and we find out that he really likes her, and he often makes her coffee.
1040.9	7.0	He makes her coffee this time also, but she never seems to want his coffee.
1048.9	12.0	Even this time we see him giving her coffee, trying to do his usual thing, but then when he leaves, she pours the coffee out the window, like in kind of a cruel way, 
1059.9	18.0	so we start feeling pretty sorry for this guy and kind of anticipate that no good can come out of this, and he, okay so he finally, like amps himself up, gets ready, like walks into the elevator and goes upstairs to get his promotion,
1076.9	4.0	and we hear that he's imagining the handshake.
1079.9	4.0	He's like seeing the moment unfold in front of his eyes.
1084.9	18.0	Unbeknownst to him, however, this whole time upstairs there's this guy named Patrick, also slender, tall, sinewy stick figure, talking to the boss, and we learn that Patrick's doing pretty well.
1101.9	13.0	He's actually being promoted himself, he's being promoted by the boss, rather than Keith, so we see Keith going up to the office as Patrick is walking out.
1114.9	13.0	Keith walks into the office and has this interaction with his boss and tries to look for the, look for the contract or something, but it's clear that he's not gonna get promoted, so he gets this news, he's pretty bummed, 
1126.9	21.0	and he gets back in the elevator, goes downstairs and walks in on Sara, the girl he was into, making out with this guy, Patrick, who just got a promotion, so basically Patrick ends up getting everything that Keith ever wanted,
1146.9	6.0	and he sort of stands there for a second, trying to process.
1152.9	5.0	Of course like, Patrick has no idea that, what's going through this guy's head.
1156.9	18.0	He walks into the elevator, and they, he and Keith are in the elevator, and Keith can see Patrick's reflection in the elevator door, like looking super confident, super happy with what just happened, 
1175.9	21.0	and I forget exactly why they start fighting, but, oh right, so I think Keith said some sort of profanity, swears at Patrick in some way, and Patrick gets really offended and punches Keith in the face, and they start, they start fighting, 
1195.9	16.0	and you see all, you see this animated blood is spurted all over the walls of the elevator, and at some point, Keith realizes that actually, he actually killed Patrick.
1210.9	11.0	He actually kills him by taking the briefcase and sort of smashing it, smashing it over his, over Patrick's head, and so that's a bummer.
1222.9	22.0	Now he needs to figure out how to, how to get rid of this body, `cause he realizes that people will probably frown upon murder, people don't like murderers, according to the narrator, so Keith takes, starts carrying Patrick's body down the stairs.
1244.9	3.0	Patrick's really heavy, this is really hard,
1247.9	5.0	and I think, oh, there was something in the beginning I forgot to mention.
1251.9	12.0	I didn't get quite how this fit in, but the guy downstairs at human resources sees someone, sees some body fall out the window or something like that, I wasn't sure what was up with that.
1263.9	6.0	Anyway, but back to Keith and Patrick, so Keith is sort of carrying Patrick down the stairs, 
1268.9	16.0	but then there's this, there's this lady who works downstairs, who decides to take a break, goes up the stairs, runs into Keith as he's trying to carry Patrick out and basically like faints at the sight of them.
1285.9	16.0	At this point, Keith decides it's probably a bad plan to try to carry Patrick all the way downstairs, so he tries to carry him to his office and out the window onto this service ladder.
1301.9	9.0	I don't remember exactly how, but Sara also ends up seeing them one more time and fainting as well.
1310.9	7.0	Keith has a revelation that yeah, probably this is how some women react to dead bodies, they just kind of faint.
1318.9	17.0	All right, so he tries to carry Patrick out the window, and I think, let's see, I'm going blank here, I think he probably, I think he dies himself.
1334.9	13.0	He manages to carry this guy, but then as he climbs the ladder, he like, I think the movie ends on him probably falling off the ladder as well.
1347.9	4.0	So that was a pretty bleak, pretty bleak animation.
1352.9	2.0	So we have that.
1357.9	3.0	Okay, cool, I think that's all for the first half.
1361.9	4.0	The second half, the first one is also an animation.
1365.9	1.0	This one's super cute.
1365.9	13.0	It's about a rock, so we see this big rock, it's stylized, it has only eyes and a nose, and it's not quite a rock, it's more like, more like a mountain, 
1377.9	14.0	and we see it as it looks around it and witnesses the, witnesses this little aquatic creature crawling onto, onto the earth.
1390.9	20.0	It's witnessing when the amphibians first got out of the water and became reptiles basically, and so we see the rock witnessing this, and the camera cuts to, to the time when there were dinosaurs, so we see a bunch of dinosaurs running around.
1409.9	7.0	There's a stegosaurus, a T-Rex, everything really lush with green.
1417.9	13.0	Then, I'm trying to remember how we end up, I'm blanking a little bit, but at some point, this rock ends up in a forest.
1429.9	9.0	It looks like it's much closer to contemporary times, it's kind of a, like, it has, leaves are pretty red, so must be fall time.
1438.9	30.0	There are animals around, and there are humans, there are workers in the forest, and this rock is like, it gets really sleepy and tries to go to sleep, but gets, gets, so these workers basically start to, how do I say this, I wish I was more bilingual, 
1468.9	16.0	okay, so these rock workers try to extract the rock, and they take her, and they basically turn her into a, into a mill rock, one of these things that you use to, to extract water from a mill.
1483.9	8.0	A millstone is what it's called, and still like this rock is kind of alive, and we see her persona.
1490.9	11.0	We see her like kind of yawning and witnessing all these things, and then, something, something fun happens, fun, unexpected.
1501.9	18.0	We see these, these Yankee, what looks like Yankee soldiers busting into these, into this mill, and we realize that we're sometime, this is happening sometime during the American Civil War, and these soldiers attack, attack the mill.
1518.9	10.0	There's a bit of, there's a fight, and they keep the rock, and they smash it to pieces, and they turn it into a, into a cannonball.
1528.9	9.0	Rock's still alive and now is a cannonball, and we see it as it flies out of, of this cannonball.
1537.9	7.0	There's a naval battle going on, and it flies and hits this other ship.
1545.9	3.0	Where does it end up next?
1548.9	21.0	I think it falls, I don't remember exactly where it falls, but I remember at some point she ends up in a forest, where she gets picked up by this Darwin-looking explorer guy, scientist guy, who sees it and gets super excited, 
1568.9	16.0	because it turns out that there's a trilobite fossil on the other side of the rock, so he takes the rock and adds it to his collection, makes some notes and presents her at some expo, at some museum.
1585.9	6.0	This museum, we learn it's in Paris, how do we learn it's in Paris?
1590.9	11.0	Oh, it's because of, right, at this museum everyone's taking photos, there's lots of flashes and this sort of like rock is confused about everything that's going on, 
1602.9	11.0	and she gets really startled when this horrendous looking boy, who reminds me of Darla from, from Finding Nemo, makes faces at the window,
1612.9	18.0	so, where she was, so the rock was in the window, she's like in this exhibit, and when this boy basically, how do I say this, like kind of like shows his face and startles the rock, 
1629.9	19.0	she falls backwards and somehow manages to fall through the pipes and ends up, ends up on the sidewalk, is being kicked around by this French young dude with a hat.
1647.9	3.0	He's sort of whistling and singing.
1650.9	11.0	This is Paris at night, we hear some French music playing in the background, and he picks up the rock and throws it at a window, and we realize it's probably his lover he's trying to get, 
1660.9	12.0	or he's throwing it at some random window, who knows, but I interpret it as he threw this rock at this window to get the attention of his lover, who's having dinner with this, with this other guy.
1673.9	8.0	And I'm blanking on what happened in between, but the rock, the rock finally ends up on a beach.
1681.9	3.0	It's really small at this point, so it started out as a big mountain.
1683.9	15.0	Now it's small, it has this kind of funny shape, and it's sort of early morning, we see this big bulldozer carrying and picking up a bunch of sand, together with the rock, 
1698.9	18.0	and it, the rock basically ends up in this glass-making factory, and we see it, together with other rocks, just kind of confused still, but she's together with other rocks like her on this assembly line, again like movie references reminding me of Toy Story,
1718.9	13.0	and she finally falls into this pit, this like cauldron where she gets melted and turned into, turned into sand and glass, and then finally she gets, she gets her moment of glory.
1730.9	19.0	She gets turned into, she gets turned into glass and gets slapped on, on top of this space telescope, and this telescope gets launched into, into the atmosphere and takes awesome, awesome photos of both galaxies far far away.
1750.9	19.0	However, at some point this mission, this mission goes wrong, and this telescope shatters among a bunch of asteroids and stars and somehow the pieces of glass turn out the rock on a planet that looks like Saturn, 
1770.9	10.0	and we cut back to later on when the rock, like after much much, like after a long time passes, again becomes a mountain like we saw at the beginning.
1779.9	11.0	We see the same kind of scene, she's very sleepy, wakes up, stares at the puddle of water in front of her, sort of like nice circular thing.
1790.9	4.0	Okay, that was the first one of the second half.
1794.9	8.0	Then we have the second one which is about the prisoner, so this was weird, and I don't remember very well, but I'll try.
1801.9	22.0	So this guy, who's a forty or fifty-year-old guy, seems very put together, very sharp, ends up in this village that looks like the Wizard of Oz, and he has these sort of like funny, funny interactions.
1822.9	8.0	At first, he meets this old woman, doesn't quite manage to figure out where he is, trying to figure out where he is, 
1830.9	10.0	and then he asks where he can make a phone call, and he's directed by the woman to get out and turn the corner, where he'll find a phone booth.
1840.9	20.0	At the phone booth, he manages to call a taxi company, and the taxi company turns out, sends this lady, taxi driver in this kind of like, maybe motorized, maybe not, rickshaw type thing.
1860.9	13.0	This lady's, she's Asian, she's wearing a funny sort of like white doctor's hat and white, white red stripy shirt.
1873.9	13.0	"She's wearing a little bit of makeup, and this guy, the, he's trying to ask her if, ""Will you please take me as far as you can to reach the next town, if you can,"" "
1885.9	7.0	"and she actually answers that, ""Well, I can't really take you to the next town. We only have the local service."""
1892.9	8.0	So she sort of shows him around and finally drops him off at what seems to be the local store.
1901.9	15.0	This guy walks into the local store, it's kind of weird `cause he's wearing this sort of tailored suit that looks like it could be the 60s or 70s, but the store looks more like end of the century, so he doesn't seem to be, 
1915.9	8.0	he seems to be quite out of place there, and he gets in the store, and he talks to the store owner, 
1922.9	11.0	"and they have some conversation I can't remember, and then this guy asks for, asks for a map, and then the store owner is like, ""Okay, I'll give you a map."""

1957.9	7.0	"He's like, ""Okay, well maybe could you give me a map that just has a larger area? Maybe something with more detail, more color,"" "
1964.9	12.0	"and the store owner says, ""Okay, sure, I'll give you something that's in color,"" pulls out another map that's bigger and still this map is just like the last one."
