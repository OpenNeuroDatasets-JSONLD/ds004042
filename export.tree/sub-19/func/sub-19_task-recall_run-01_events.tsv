9.9	10.0	Okay, so the very first thing that happened was a little interlude thing like in a drive-in movie theater.
18.9	9.0	"There was a dancing popcorn and soda and they were singing ""let's all go to the lobby to get ourselves a treat."""
27.9	3.0	That happened at the beginning of both sections.
29.9	7.0	I think I've seen that before, at a drive-in movie theater or some kind of old movie theater, like a really old advertising.
37.9	9.0	Then I think the first one in the first section was a snippet from the movie Catch Me If You Can, which is the only one of these that I've seen before.
46.9	4.0	And it opens and there's kind of like a game show.
50.9	11.0	And I think the game show, it's supposed to be the kind of game show where there's three people and one of them is really the famous figure and they're going to ask him questions.
60.9	4.0	And it's number 2 and it's Leonardo di Caprio, he's this famous con artist.
65.9	9.0	They ask the first guy a question, they ask the second guy a question, which I think is, who finally caught you as being a con artist?
73.9	3.0	He starts to answer and it starts to go into his memory.
76.9	13.0	And it's Tom Hanks who's the investigator guy and he showed up at a prison, I think it's a German prison or something, to try to extradite the con artist.
88.9	11.0	And he's having a hard time, he's standing in the rain with his umbrella and talking to the German prison people and having a really hard time making himself understood and speaking slowly.
98.9	5.0	He's got kind of a funny, maybe, Southern accent, some kind of a funny accent, Tom Hanks does. 
104.9	5.0	And he finally goes in and he gets to see Leonardo di Caprio.
110.9	6.0	And it's through, he's in this little cell and it's really dingy and it's dripping.
116.9	7.0	Tom Hanks gets under his umbrella to shield himself from the dripping from the ceiling, which is a funny moment.
123.9	5.0	And he's trying to read him something through this little window into his cell.
127.9	8.0	And he's all coughing and miserable and sick and bedraggled with long beard and hair and dirty, with a blanket.
136.9	8.0	Tom Hanks is having none of it, he thinks he's conning him, he's not really sick, but eventually he just starts acting sicker and sicker and collapses.
144.9	13.0	And he calls for a doctor and gets him to get the guy out and take him to the little prison infirmary and they drop him on the bed in the prison infirmary.
156.9	8.0	And then they go out and they're talking, they leave him by himself on the bed with the sort of curtain around the bed.
163.9	8.0	They're talking about something and then they hear, you hear the door kind of close and they notice that he's gone, he's escaped from the bed.
173.9	14.0	And the scene switches to Leonardo kind of obviously still sick legitimately sick but hobbling and stumbling down some prison hallway and the prisoners are all cheering.
187.9	6.0	And they catch him and put a gun to his head and he collapses himself backwards on the floor and surrenders.
192.9	4.0	And that I guess is the story of how he was caught.
197.9	4.0	Ok that one I probably remember better than any of the others
200.9	10.0	moving on from there, the next one, I'm not sure if it was the next one, I think it was the next one, was either animated or a Claymation 
209.9	3.0	and it was of a girl and she had a box of pizza.
211.9	9.0	And she was in her room, she looked like she was, I don't know, like a young adult kind of a woman, maybe like in her 20s or something like that.
220.9	4.0	And an envelope shows up at her door and in the envelope is a record.
223.9	4.0	She puts the record on the record player and starts playing it.
227.9	6.0	Uh, trying to remember the song of the record, it was like story of life or something like that.
232.9	7.0	And as it was playing, the pizza was shrinking. She was eating the pizza but then it was shrinking.
239.9	9.0	And she pushes the record back and forth and notices that she can make the pizza appear and disappear as she pushes the record back and forth.
247.9	3.0	This record is like transporting her forward and back through time.
252.9	7.0	So she pushes it forward and sees her whole pizza disappear, pushes it backwards, sees her whole pizza reappear again.
259.9	7.0	And then the rest of the clip is her picking it up and putting it in different spots and like skipping around through her life.
265.9	7.0	So she puts it forward and she is a slightly older woman and she's pregnant.
271.9	7.0	She's putting the record back and forth and her belly is getting bigger and smaller and bigger and smaller as she's pushing the record back and forth.
277.9	4.0	And then she skips it forward a little bit more and she's standing there holding a baby.
281.9	6.0	And she picks it up and pushes it way back, and she herself is now like a toddler holding a baby doll.
288.9	5.0	And she toddles over to it, and pushes it forward and now she's old and she's in a wheelchair.
293.9	5.0	And this one's kind of funny because she's trying to get over to it in her wheelchair but the record keeps skipping.
297.9	8.0	Whenever it skips she gets reset so she'll wheel towards it, the record will skip, and so she'll jump back, wheel towards it, the record will skip, she'll jump back.
307.9	5.0	And she makes it, there's one more, I think she's old again in a walker and she's trying to get to it.
311.9	17.0	This one's kind of sad because she's racing towards it, her walker, she's not moving very fast and she can't get to it and it ends, the record ends, she plop becomes an urn sitting on the floor, and that's the end of that little clip.
329.9	6.0	I don't know which clip was the third clip so I'm just going to pick another one to go with.
335.9	4.0	And the next one I'm thinking of is probably the most similar one to that one.
338.9	5.0	It's also animated and this one was called The Rock or the Stone or something like that.
343.9	9.0	And it opens and there are some prehistoric creatures moving around in the ocean and there's a mountain and the mountain has a face on it and kind of a circular nose.
351.9	4.0	This mountain is going to be the protagonist of the clip.
355.9	13.0	And as time advances and this mountain erodes away, you see there's, they're like, dinosaurs come and go, there's a big snow with glaciers and there's wooly mammoths.
368.9	4.0	And the mountain is shrinking and it's becoming a smaller and smaller rock.
373.9	8.0	And the mountain is now like a boulder and on top of the boulder is a tree and they're some guys who are trying to cut down the tree.
380.9	5.0	And the boulder gets really disgruntled and stands up and walks into the woods to hide from these guys.
384.9	4.0	It seems like his main motivation, he just wants to sleep all the time.
388.9	11.0	So he goes into the woods and sleeps but his sleep doesn't last long because he gets pulled out of the woods by some people and gets dragged away and he becomes a millstone, one of those stones.
398.9	6.0	He's in a water wheel, attached to a water wheel, spinning around and making, I guess you use it to make grain or something like that.
405.9	3.0	He doesn't like that at all because he's now been machined to be perfectly round.
407.9	4.0	He's spinning around and he's dizzy and he's not happy about that.
411.9	5.0	Then um, what happens to the rock after that?
416.9	6.0	Oh some people come, they're like soldiers, revolutionary, like civil war, I guess they're civil war soldiers.
421.9	16.0	They come and they take the rock away and they make him into the cannon balls and he's shot, they take him on the ship, they shoot him at another ship, he breaks the mast of the Confederate ship and lands in the ocean, sinks into the ocean.
438.9	7.0	And I don't remember what happens to him after that; at some point he becomes a fossil, he's picked up by a fossil collector.
444.9	4.0	He's got some marine, ancient marine fossil inside of him.
448.9	4.0	And then he falls out of the museum and goes rolling through the city.
451.9	3.0	Someone picks him up and throws him through a window at some point.
454.9	5.0	And then at the end of it he becomes, he's eroded down, he finally becomes sand 
459.9	3.0	and the sand gets picked up and melted into glass 
461.9	5.0	and the glass is put on the front of a satellite, he's shot into space, this rock.
467.9	4.0	And something happens to the satellite, he ends up crashing on another planet, 
471.9	14.0	and the closing scene in the one about the rock is this cracked piece of glass with this rock character inside of it has become part of a mountain on another planet, that now has prehistoric life, so the plot has come full circle.
487.9	3.0	That's what I remember about the one about the rock.
492.9	2.0	What's another one.
493.9	4.0	I guess another animated one is about the colorful stick figures.
496.9	10.0	There's a colorful stick figure guy who shows up at a building full of stick figures, and the stick figure guy goes to work and he thinks he's going to get a promotion and he goes up, he gets into the elevator.
505.9	10.0	It looks kind of like a Sim tower, sort of all profile kind of a shot with the camera's panning up and down through this building.
516.9	5.0	And he gets into the elevator and he goes to the floor where his love interest, which is the pink stick figure, is.
521.9	5.0	And he offers his love interest, the pink stick figure, a cup of coffee.
526.9	4.0	He's obviously not being very successful with his love interest.
529.9	2.0	She doesn't want a cup of coffee.
530.9	6.0	She drops it out the window and it lands on a window washer guy who falls down the window.
536.9	7.0	Then our stick figure guy gets back in the elevator and heads up to the boss' office, anticipating his promotion.
542.9	4.0	And he gets to the boss' office just as green stick figure is walking out.
545.9	8.0	And the green stick figure is walking very confidently and happily because he's been given the promotion blue stick figure guy was supposed to get.
553.9	5.0	The blue stick figure guy, he goes into the office and he's told that he doesn't get his promotion.
557.9	9.0	Meanwhile, green stick figure is down with pink love interest stick figure and they're kissing down there.
565.9	8.0	And blue stick figure guy is dejected, he doesn't get his promotion, he goes out, he goes down to the floor where the pink stick figure is and he sees them.
574.9	7.0	And he is miserable, because he didn't get his promotion and his love interest is now kissing this other guy and everything is awful in his life.
581.9	12.0	And green stick figure guy comes into the elevator, into the elevator with him and they get into a fight and the blue stick figure murders the green stick figure.
593.9	4.0	That was not what he was intending to do, but he does.
597.9	3.0	And what happens after that?
599.9	3.0	He's trying to take him, he's trying to sneak him out of the building.
602.9	2.0	He doesn't want to take the elevator.
604.9	7.0	He's trying to sneak him down the stairs and as he's trying to sneak him down the stairs he runs into another stick figure person, yellow stick figure person.
612.9	11.0	Yellow stick figure person's on her way upstairs to the bathroom and she see the blue guy dragging the dead green guy and she faints and falls down the stairs, and I think she dies herself on the stairs.
623.9	11.0	So then our green guy knows that he can't take the stairs anymore or take the elevator down anymore and he sees this ladder on the window which is the ladder left by the window washer guy that fell from the coffee earlier in the story.
635.9	4.0	And so he goes out the window and I guess he just drops the green guy down.
638.9	8.0	He's on the ladder himself and he's teetering and it sort of pant back and becomes a little philosophical.
645.9	7.0	And it ends there with him teetering on the ladder outside the window and someone inside, I guess the janitor, watching him teeter.
654.9	2.0	Ok what's another one.
655.9	4.0	I think those are all of the animated ones.
659.9	6.0	The next one that comes to mind is the one with the guy at the copier and the black hole.
664.9	9.0	So he prints, something weird is happening with the copier machine, he's trying to copy something, and out comes this page and on the page is this big black circle.
673.9	1.0	It's printed.
674.9	3.0	And that's wasn't what he wanted so he puts it down and tries to copy this other thing.
676.9	4.0	He goes to put his coffee cup down, the coffee cup falls through the black circle.
679.9	8.0	It's one of those like Acme instant holes in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, it's kind of a hole where you can just reach through.
688.9	8.0	So he reaches his arm inside and his arm disappears and he goes through and he's able to grab his coffee cup from down below.
697.9	9.0	So he's surprised and interested by this thing so he goes to the vending machine and he slaps the hole on the vending machine, reaches his arm through, and gets a candy bar from the vending machine.
706.9	2.0	And so he gets a really good idea.
708.9	7.0	He goes over to the money room, puts the hole on the door, reaches through the hole, and he opens the door from the other side which is locked.
715.9	6.0	And he goes to the safe, and he puts his hole on the safe and he's reaching through and taking money out of the safe.
721.9	4.0	And he's taking money out of the safe, taking money out of the safe, and very pleased with himself.
725.9	10.0	And then to get the last little bit of money he's reaching his arm further and further and further and he ends up crawling, putting his whole arm in, then his whole head in, and his whole body through the hole.
734.9	4.0	And then, the paper falls and he's stuck inside the safe.
737.9	7.0	And it ends with that guy stuck inside of the safe sort of banging, banging and trying to get out.
746.9	3.0	Um, what's another story.
748.9	4.0	Another story is the robot boyfriend story.
751.9	3.0	I think it was called High Maintenance or something like that.
754.9	10.0	And in the robot boyfriend story there's a couple, they're at dinner, and there's not a lot of conversation happening, they're not that happy.
763.9	11.0	The lady, the girl tries to pour the guy some wine and he refuses the wine and they're still not talking, and it's a very awkward, sort of those long, long tables, and they're very far away from each other.
775.9	2.0	He says he can't have wine because he's on call.
777.9	3.0	She's complaining about what a boring guy he is.
779.9	5.0	He's definitely, his characterization is that he is a pretty boring guy.
786.9	12.0	So she snaps and she complains, she says it's not, today is their anniversary, this is not how I wanted to spend my anniversary right here with this boring guy, I think mechanical slow sex.
798.9	5.0	And so she goes up to him and she apologizes and says I didn't mean it.
803.9	3.0	And she reaches a switch on the back of his neck and she turns him off.
806.9	3.0	He's turned off there at the table.
808.9	10.0	She goes to her computer, she's on like an online catalogue of robot boyfriends and she finds a much better robot boyfriend.
817.9	11.0	She calls the robot company and says I'm not satisfied with my robot boyfriend, he's really boring, he's got no sense of adventure, so I'd like an upgrade, an upgraded one.
828.9	5.0	So she orders an upgraded one, who's like a rock climber masseuse or something like that.
832.9	3.0	The new one shows up, the old one goes away.
836.9	6.0	Then they're back, they're sitting at dinner with the new robot boyfriend.
842.9	8.0	And there's some dialogue that's repeated from the first conversation, something about asparagus, where he's now taking her role.
851.9	4.0	And he goes over and he's giving her a massage and he turns her off.
855.9	9.0	And then he goes over to the TV and it ends with him smoking a cigarette, drinking a beer, eating chips, and watching football on the television or something.
865.9	3.0	That's the parallelism of it.
870.9	2.0	And, what's another story?
879.9	2.0	Well I can remember the last story.
881.9	4.0	In the last story there's a guy, and he's standing waiting for a bus, and he's wearing headphones.
884.9	5.0	And he's got a bag, I think he's got ice cream or something in the bag, a grocery bag.
889.9	3.0	And he looks really hot and miserable and sweaty.
892.9	6.0	And a car pulls up really fast, slams on the brakes, and comes to a really fast stop next to a payphone.
898.9	7.0	And a lady gets out of the car, she goes over to the payphone and she's obviously distraught about something with this payphone.
905.9	4.0	The payphone's not working so she comes across the street to the guy and she asks to borrow his phone.
909.9	9.0	And as that's happening her car starts to roll away, which is funny, because she doesn't notice and nobody else in the story notices that her car is rolling away but I really think it was rolling away.
919.9	11.0	So she asks him for his phone, and he agrees to let her use his phone, and she makes some phone call, and it sounds like she's talking to a mobster or something.
929.9	6.0	She's threatening to go to the police and she's distraught and she's angry and she ends up throwing the phone on the ground and breaking the phone.
936.9	4.0	She says I'm here, yeah that's what she says when she picks up the phone, yeah she says I'm here.
941.9	9.0	And so the guy, and then she goes and she's just standing in the road and the guy whose phone it was picks up the phone and he's mad because she broke his phone.
950.9	6.0	He's actually not that mad, he's just confused and awkward.
955.9	4.0	Hey, uh miss, I think you, this phone is broken.
958.9	4.0	Can I, could you give me some money for my phone that you broke?
962.9	3.0	She's not really paying attention to him at all.
964.9	10.0	Then a car pulls up and stops and a guy gets out in a I don't know like fancy suit sort of an outfit.
976.9	7.0	He goes and he's having a conversation with the lady, an angry one, what's she asking.
982.9	2.0	She's like, where is she?
983.9	2.0	Where is she, she wants to know.
986.9	12.0	Then the guy in the car is asking her, so the guy with the phone has been following her trying to get her to pay attention and give him money for his phone and he says, who is this, goes, you know who I am?
998.9	5.0	He recognizes him, he's a magician from, he says the magician from the casino.
1004.9	8.0	And then at some point I don't know if this was before or after this, the lady pulls out a gun and she's threatening the guy and she wants to know where is she, tell me now.
1011.9	5.0	The magician pulls out a little, with some slight of hand pulls out a little magic gun.
1017.9	4.0	So they're threatening each other.
1023.9	6.0	At some point then the lady goes around to the magician guy's car and she's trying to get to the trunk.
1029.9	6.0	At the same time the magician guy has started kind of hypnotizing the phone guy.
1036.9	6.0	He's got some little box which is like a coffin and it's got some bones inside and he's reading some magic words.
1043.9	7.0	And the phone guy, he's getting delirious and he passes out, his ice cream is melted, splattered on the ground next to him.
1049.9	3.0	He's passed out on the road.
1052.9	13.0	And as that happens the magician goes shit and he pulls out of his pocket a little piece of paper, I guess it's got the magic words on it, and he's repeating them muttering the magic words under his breath like he did something wrong.
1064.9	8.0	And in the meantime the lady has gotten open the trunk of the car and is looking appalled at what she sees in there and hears barking coming from inside.
1073.9	7.0	And then the phone guy wakes up and the phone guy has become a dog, barking, and he's walking around on all fours.
1080.9	9.0	And the lady comes over and sees him, she's on the ground, the dog guy's on the ground, the magician guy's on the ground.
1089.9	7.0	She shoots the magician guy and the magician guy shoots her and phone guy has now become a dog barking, he's walking around on all fours.
1095.9	10.0	Out of the trunk comes another girl, who's also a dog, I guess the one the first lady was asking about.
1104.9	5.0	So now they're both dogs and they're acting like dogs and they're like sniffing each other and barking at each other.
1109.9	6.0	And they walk off together under the bridge and that's the end of that one.
1116.9	3.0	I am missing a lot of them.
1121.9	7.0	So there's one called the Village or the Prisoner or something like that.
1129.9	6.0	It looks like it's from, it's a Wizard of Oz style cinematography, so it's an older movie I think.
1136.9	4.0	And there's a guy and he's sort of confused about where he is.
1139.9	9.0	He's at a cafe and he's trying to ask the lady, the cafe lady, what village he's in and where the village is, and she's totally confused.
1149.9	9.0	But she directs him to a place where he can make a phone call, and he picks up the phone, and it's sort of a weird looking phone, it's not a payphone, it's a cordless phone, sitting there.
1159.9	7.0	He talks to the, there's an operator on the other side of the phone, he wants to know where he is and she won't tell him, she just wants to know what is his number.
1166.9	5.0	He says he doesn't have a number and she says no number, no phone call, hangs up on him.
1172.9	9.0	Then he finds some kind of a board with buttons on it and it's got a map of the village that says the village and he pushes a button for a taxi and the taxi lady shows up.
1180.9	12.0	He's trying to get the taxi lady to tell him where he is, or can she take him out of the village, and she says no, it's a local taxi only and so he says take me as far as you can and gets into the taxi and they go.
1193.9	3.0	Then she goes as far as she can which is not that far.
1196.9	10.0	And then, he goes into a shop, and there's a shopkeeper there and he's talking to the shopkeeper, the shopkeeper's talking in Italian or something to a lady and they switch to English as he walks in.
1207.9	3.0	And then he walks into the shop and he asks the shopkeeper for a map.
1210.9	5.0	And the shop guy asks him if it's a color or black and white map he wants, and he doesn't care, he just wants a map.
1215.9	4.0	So he gets a map and the map is just a map of one village.
1218.9	8.0	It's a very small village, it's only got a couple buildings in it and around it it's just really vague, it just says the mountains, the mountains, the sea, there's no details.
1225.9	13.0	So he asks for a larger map and after a bunch of fuss the guy gets him out a larger map which is colored this time, and the larger map doesn't show any bigger area, it's just a physically larger map but exactly the same thing.
1239.9	2.0	And I think that's the end of that one.
1240.9	9.0	I guess it's the beginning of some movie where he's trapped in this you know weird Twilight Zone sort of a situation.
1253.9	2.0	I know I'm forgetting a lot of these.
1257.9	2.0	Trying to remember more.
1291.9	5.0	There’s catch me if you can, there’s that Claymation one, the pizza.
1300.9	2.0	What came after that?
1309.9	4.0	Uh, I don't know, I think I only remembered about half of them.
1348.9	4.0	I don't know, I'm not remembering anymore, I guess I'm done.
1351.9	3.0	I guess I'm ready to see the titles.
