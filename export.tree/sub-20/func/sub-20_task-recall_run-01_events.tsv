136.9	4.0	So they get him out of the jail cell, and they bring him up to the hospital.
140.9	8.0	And he’s asking the guys about the doctor, and he says like, “Don’t ruin it for me. I’ve been chasing this guy forever.”
147.9	11.0	And then they say, as they're talking, “The doctor will be there tomorrow,” and as they're talking, I guess Leo Dicaprio’s character escapes through the door.
158.9	14.0	And they look at the empty bed, and the door is ajar, and so they go through the door, and Leo Dicaprio’s character’s running down the hallway, and all the prisoners are up on the second level screaming.
172.9	6.0	And he's like collapsing ‘cause he’s really sick, and he's falling, but he's trying to run.
177.9	7.0	And then he collapses, and the guards and Tom Hanks catch up to him, and one of the guards puts a gun to his head.
184.9	9.0	And then he sort of gives up and falls on the floor with his arms up, and he says like, “Alright, take me home.”
194.9	8.0	And then there was a clip about the, this girl’s eating a pizza,
201.9	8.0	and she gets a package outside the door, and it’s a record, and so she puts on the record.
209.9	9.0	And as she spins the record forward, like time passes, and her pizza’s half eaten.
218.9	7.0	And she spins the record forward more, and more time passes, and like the whole box is eaten and the candle goes down.
224.9	4.0	And then she spins the record back, and it undoes that.
227.9	5.0	And so she keeps spinning it forward and back.
231.9	3.0	And so then she spins it forward and she’s pregnant.
234.9	9.0	Then she spins it back and she's not pregnant, and forward and she's pregnant again, and then forward a bit more and she's holding a baby, and the baby starts screaming.
242.9	4.0	So she screams for, she spins it forward more.
246.9	6.0	And then she's in a wheelchair with her leg broken.
252.9	10.0	And she's trying to reach it to spin it, the record, but she can't reach it, because she keeps getting electrocuted or something.
262.9	9.0	And then she, it goes backward, and she's trying to reach it, she can't reach it, and she falls backwards.
271.9	7.0	And then she gets really old, ‘cause I guess the record jumped, and she's in a walker and she's really old.
278.9	3.0	She's trying to get to the record, and she can't.
281.9	9.0	And then the record skips ahead again, and it’s, she's in an urn, and the lid is like, you know, bouncing or something.
290.9	16.0	And then there's a Boyfriend clip, where there’s this woman, and she's eating dinner and having sort of stilted conversation with this guy, and they're at opposite ends of the table.
305.9	8.0	And she's trying to offer him wine, and he's like, “You know I can’t drink wine when I'm on call.”
312.9	11.0	And she says, she drinks, and she's not happy about that, and so she drinks a lot of wine.
322.9	5.0	Or she finishes her cup of wine, and then she pours herself more.
327.9	5.0	And then she spills, like throws wine on his face.
332.9	14.0	And they're talking about the asparagus and how it’s tender, and she says, “It’s an aphrodisiac,” and he says, “Who says that?”
345.9	6.0	And then she, so yeah, she spills wine on his head, and she gets upset.
350.9	3.0	And then he starts lighting a cigarette.
352.9	8.0	And she is like, “Don’t smoke in my house,” and then she puts out his cigarette, and he lights another one.
359.9	11.0	And then she like screams at him, like, you know, something about their relationship and how it’s unhappy, and they’ve like, quick, short mechanical sex.
370.9	7.0	And then she sits on his lap, and she's like apologizing.
377.9	3.0	I guess tonight’s their anniversary.
379.9	7.0	And so she's like sort of upset on his lap.
385.9	7.0	Then she reaches around his neck and flips this switch.
391.9	7.0	And then she gets on her computer, and she's looking at all these models of male sort of robots.
398.9	6.0	And she calls the help line, and she sort of complains about the 100 model.
404.9	20.0	And the help line, and she says like, you know, “He lacks ambition, and he is,” I forget the other thing, but she, the help line lady says, you know, “That’s a problem with these, this model.”
423.9	14.0	And so she says, you know, “We could upgrade you,” and she says, “Yeah, I’d like to be upgraded to a rock climber masseuse, with less of a beard and shorter hair.”
436.9	8.0	And so then they deliver her her new like robotic man, I guess like very realistic robotic man.
443.9	6.0	And he's the one she like requested.
448.9	9.0	And so he comes in, and the other guy gets wheeled out, who’s like shut down, and then new guy hasn’t been activated yet.
456.9	14.0	And as they're wheeling out the old guy, she, you sort of see the picture frame of their wedding, and she runs toward him and kisses him and then takes off his wedding ring, and then slips it on the new boyfriend.
470.9	8.0	And, or husband I guess, and then they sit down at dinner, and you know he slowly comes to life.
478.9	14.0	And so he grabs the napkin in sort of a clunky manner, and then she is sitting across the table, and he asks if she wants, if he wants wine, and she says, he says no, because he has a climb tomorrow.
492.9	9.0	And then she, she says, she sort of looks upset, because she kind of wanted a boyfriend that would drink with her.
501.9	5.0	And then he says, you know, “Asparagus is an aphrodisiac.”
505.9	4.0	And she says, “Who says that?” and he says, “I don’t know.”

514.9	8.0	And she says she got lunch with Anna, and then she got stuff for dinner tonight, since it’s their anniversary.
521.9	11.0	And she, and then as he's massaging her, he switches off her switch, ‘cause it turns out she’s a robot too.
531.9	5.0	And then he goes down and sits and watches TV and smokes a cigarette.
537.9	6.0	And then there's the Shoe clip, where there's a zoomed in picture of the shoe.
542.9	7.0	And then this guy is walking, and everything he does, the girl sort of copies.
548.9	9.0	And as they're walking down the street, you know, he sort of waves, and she waves back, and then he sort of like, you know, walks funny, and she walks funny, 
556.9	8.0	and then she walks down behind this sort of like box, and she's hidden from view, and he copies her then.
563.9	11.0	And then she walks to the intersection, and she sort of like waves at him to stop, but he doesn’t get it, and he like waves back at her and keeps going, ‘cause he's like mimicking her.
574.9	4.0	And then he gets hit by a car, and he likes cracks the windshield.
578.9	12.0	And then the car like goes airborne, and then the car flips over and crashes, and the window pane falls out.
592.9	5.0	And then there’s Keith Reynolds, and it says, “Keith Reynolds can't make it tonight.”
596.9	6.0	And um 
602.9	5.0	then he, there's a cartoon, and he's like going into work.

624.9	7.0	And today’s the day when he wants to get a promotion, and he wants the promotion, ‘cause there's this girl that he likes.
631.9	12.0	And so as he walks in through the entryway, there's people like tossing paper into the trashcan, and I guess there's a, someone sitting at the desk.
642.9	10.0	And he goes up to the floor where there's a lady who is the one he likes, and he always gives her coffee.
651.9	3.0	I think it’s Sara is the girl’s name.
653.9	10.0	And he gives her coffee, but apparently she doesn’t like coffee, so she throws it out the window, and it hits the guy who I think is cleaning the windows.
662.9	15.0	And he falls down, and then a guy on the floor below, like HR guy, sees the guy fall down past the window, and he like doesn’t know what it is, so he looks out the window, and he sees someone on the ground, so he calls an ambulance.
676.9	10.0	And so then Keith Richards goes up to another floor on the elevator, or another couple floors to see about his promotion.
686.9	11.0	And the guy who’s in there right before is getting a promotion, and so he's get a really firm handshake, and he's signing with this pen.
696.9	17.0	And then Keith, sorry Reynolds, gets out of the elevator, and the other guy gets in, and he rides down, and the other guy like rides down and gets with Sara, ‘cause Sara would want the guy to get the promotion.
713.9	10.0	Whereas like Keith is, goes into the meeting about the promotion, and the handshake is not as firm as he thought it would be, and he doesn’t see the pen.
722.9	7.0	He doesn’t think he's gonna get the promotion, and he doesn’t, but the other guy who got it is like making out with Sara.

736.9	10.0	And the guy’s like, and when the elevator door opens, he sees the other guy making out with Sara, and then the guy gets in the elevator with him.
745.9	8.0	And then as Keith gets off the elevator, he says something to the guy that he's never said to anyone before.
752.9	8.0	Then the other guy gets upset, and he like punches Keith, and he's wondering if he's gonna be bruised tomorrow.
760.9	10.0	Then he punches back, and he like beats the other guy up, and the other guy falls down, and then he like swings like his briefcase into the other guy’s head, and he kills the guy.
770.9	12.0	And then he drags, then he’s trying to realize what to do with the dead body, and this other woman wants, has to go upstairs for some reason, I forget why.
781.9	10.0	And the guy, and you think she's gonna take the elevator, but then apparently she had a New Year’s resolution, so she takes up the stairs.
790.9	9.0	Then Keith’s like, he doesn’t wanna ride the elevator, ‘cause somebody could call the elevator, and then he’d see him with this dead body and all bloody and stuff.
799.9	4.0	And so he drags him down the stairs, and so they run into this lady.
802.9	9.0	And then she, as she's walking up the stairs, on the sixth floor or something, then she falls back when she sees Keith dragging this dead body.
810.9	6.0	And then she hits her head, and she dies, and he's like, “That was an accident.”
816.9	15.0	And then he keeps going, and then he's like, “Maybe I shouldn’t walk down the stairs,” and so he's gonna go out through the window, ‘cause he sees a ladder there, which is the ladder that that other guy fell off of.
830.9	8.0	And so as he's going up the ladder, then Sara comes to see this guy she likes, I think his name is Sam maybe.
837.9	10.0	And she sees the dead body, and Keith dragging it, and she faints, but she doesn’t die, because she's not near the stairs.
846.9	8.0	And then he throws the other guy out the window, and then he is on the ladder.
853.9	8.0	And there's this new guy who’s like mopping the floor, and he sees him, and Keith’s like balancing on the ladder.
864.9	3.0	And then there's a clip about a rock.
867.9	10.0	And the rock starts out like a little, a big mountain, it's sleepy, and it goes through all its life cycle of the rock.
876.9	9.0	And so first it’s this big rock, mountain rock, and there's like dinosaurs and stuff.

892.9	8.0	And he's trying to go back to bed, but the like construction is making a lot of noise, or like go back to sleep, and so the.
900.9	10.0	The rock can't sleep, so he like picks up and moves, and he moves to this other spot, where he's sort of on the side of a bigger rock.
909.9	5.0	And then these guys come and get him, so they can turn him into a wheel.
913.9	15.0	And so they shave him down, and then he's like in sort of this like, not a factory, but like a place, and he's like being spun around.

935.9	4.0	Like near, I don’t know, whatever, 
938.9	3.0	and the rock is being spun around.

1057.9	10.0	And then he and the girl send post-it like cute messages back and forth, like making drawings and things.
1066.9	11.0	And so he puts a like, she raises the blinds, and there's like a sun made out of post-it notes on her window.
1077.9	16.0	And then he goes into the bathroom, and he's looking at the mirror, and one of the stalls a guy goes into, and there's like a thought cloud with a heart in it, like just attached to his head while he's looking at the mirror.
1093.9	10.0	And then he, she goes into a closet, and she turns on the light with one of those dangling chains.
1102.9	10.0	And then there's like a bouquet of flowers that looks like she's holding from her hand being up holding the chain.
1112.9	5.0	And then she grabs like a whole armful of post-it notes.
1116.9	11.0	She walks down to make like a drawing for this guy on this big empty wall, except he already made a drawing of the two of them, and he's like finishing her barrette.
1127.9	4.0	And she walks in, and it’s both their faces.
1133.9	8.0	And then there's the Bus Stop, where there’s this guy who’s hanging out there, and he's super sweaty, and he's holding like an ice cream.
1141.9	14.0	And he's waiting for the bus, and this woman drives up, and she gets out of the car, and she tries to use a payphone, and it’s not working, and the car’s sort of like rolling away.

1159.9	11.0	And the guy’s like, “Okay,” and so he gives it to her, and she calls, and she's like talking to somebody on the phone, and she's like, “I’m here.”
1169.9	6.0	And the guy is like watching her.
1174.9	2.0	She looks really upset.
1176.9	5.0	And then she, at the end of the conversation, she throws the phone down and breaks it.
1180.9	8.0	And then he’s like the one who lent her the phone, and so he looks at his broken phone, and he's like, “It’s broken. Can I have sixty dollars?”
1187.9	4.0	And she's like not really paying attention to him.
1191.9	7.0	Then this other car drives up, and this guy gets out, and the woman’s like, “Where is she?”
1197.9	14.0	And this guy who was waiting and all sweaty with the headphones, he's walking over there, and he's like, you know, “Can I have sixty dollars?” and this guy’s like, the guy who drove up is like, “Who is that?” and she's like, “It’s a friend.”
1211.9	2.0	And then, um
1217.9	4.0	the woman’s still really upset and trying to figure out “Where is she?”
1220.9	10.0	And she gets out a gun and points it at both of them, and the guy is like, “Do you recognize us?”
1229.9	6.0	And he's like, “Oh you're the magician, and she's your assistant.”
1236.9	13.0	And so I guess that happened earlier, and then the guy gets out, is a magician, and he's like, makes a gun appear in his hand sort of magically.
1249.9	3.0	And then he's pointing a gun at her.
1252.9	7.0	And then he starts doing this sort of spell on the guy.
1259.9	9.0	And she goes around, the woman goes around to the trunk of the car and is trying to open the trunk, but she can't really get it open.
1267.9	10.0	And then he's meanwhile doing this spell, and the guy’s sort of getting all drowsy and like the ice cream all melted pours out.
1276.9	7.0	And then the woman opens up the trunk, and I guess whatever she sees in there makes her really upset.
1282.9	5.0	And I, we don’t know yet what she sees, and so she comes out.
1287.9	7.0	And the guy is trying to remember the end of the spell, and so he grabs a crumpled up piece of paper.
1293.9	5.0	And meanwhile she shoots him.
1297.9	5.0	And the other, the guy who was having the spell be done on him sort of falls down.
1302.9	9.0	And the other guy, the magician sort of shoots back at the woman, and so they're both dead, the magician and his helper.
1310.9	4.0	And the other guy sort of turns into a dog.
1313.9	5.0	Then we find out there's this woman in the trunk, and she had also been turned into a dog.
1318.9	10.0	And so the guy who’s now a dog like eats the melted ice cream, and then the girl comes out, and they're like barking to each other.
1327.9	6.0	And then they like approach each other and sort of sniff each other like dogs.
1332.9	8.0	Then he rolls on his back, and then they sort of like walk away together, I mean like crawl away like dogs.
1343.9	9.0	There was also the Prisoner, where this guy is in this like town, and he's trying to figure out where it is, and it’s called Your Village.
1351.9	5.0	And he is trying to figure out where it is and get out of it.
1356.9	3.0	And he can't like, nobody will answer him.
1358.9	6.0	And so he goes into this shop, and they're not really helpful.
1363.9	13.0	And then he goes out and he sees this map with like a light-up board, and so he presses something, and it calls a taxi.
1375.9	6.0	And this woman comes up, and she's talking to him in French, and she says something to him like, “ou est-ce que tu veux aller.”
1381.9	7.0	"And he's like, “Can you take me out of this town? Why did you speak to me in French?” and she's like, “Well it’s really international."""
1387.9	4.0	"""I thought maybe you were like Czech or Polish or something.”"
1391.9	7.0	They're driving, she's like, he's trying to get her to like drive her outside of this town, and she's says it’s only a local taxi.
1398.9	3.0	So she drops him off at this store.
1400.9	3.0	And he goes in this store, and he asks for a map.
1403.9	4.0	And the guy’s like, “Do you want black or white or color?” and he's like, “I don’t really care.”
1406.9	7.0	And the guy was speaking in another language when he walks in the store, not French or English, like.
1414.9	5.0	And so then he asks for the map, and the guy gives him a black and white map.
1419.9	8.0	And it’s like not really helpful ‘cause it’s just like a map of the village with like mountains and sea, and it says like “Your Village.”
1426.9	5.0	And he's like, “Can I have a larger map?” and he's like, “Well I have color, but it will be a lot more expensive.”
1431.9	15.0	And he's like, “That’s okay,” and then he asks him for the color map, and he gets it, and it’s larger, but it’s actually the same map, like it doesn’t extend any further,
1446.9	5.0	and he's like, “Actually I want a larger area,” and the guy’s like, “Oh no, I only have local maps.”
1455.9	3.0	Let me think what other clips there were. 
1485.9	3.0	I'm trying to think about the other clips. 
1498.9	3.0	Sorry, I think that’s all I can do. I’m done.
